       "      <td>I am a current resident at this complex and let me just say, it has been the worst apartment living situation I have ever lived in. We moved in at the end of March 2019 and loved the apartment and the community. After 3 months, we began smelling marijuana in our apartment. Since this is a &amp;quot;non smoking&amp;quot; community, it was a bit of a shock to have our master bedroom and bathroom stinking from marijuana smell. So, I called and complained. The complex did what it always does which is to send a letter to each apartment saying not to smoke. Every month after that, we complained about the smell filling our apartment. In September of 2019 we were still having the issue and the complex would never come to actually check out the problem. Finally it got so bad that after numerous complaints, the complex decided to evict our neighbors months later. The neighbors somehow found out we complained and vandalized our vehicles. They broke my windshield on my car and also the side mirror of my partner&amp;apos;s car. This was allowed to occur because the complex gave the tenants a week to move instead of just taking care of it right away. We had to call the police and file a report. At this point, I had had enough and went into the office to complain. The manager at the time offered no help whatsoever so I had to go to the District Manager to finally get results. After the neighbors got evicted, that apartment was empty for a month or 2 and we did not have the smoke problem. Then after getting new neighbors, we had the same problem. Our bathroom and bedroom began smelling of marijuana. We complained and got the usual response of &amp;quot;we&amp;apos;ll send a letter and call&amp;quot;. One day while leaving my apartment, I found a baggie of marijuana laying on the stairs. I took a picture and emailed it to the office and their response was that they found it hard to believe that there was a bag of weed left on the steps. So now, the complex started downplaying our complaints and making us feel like we were lying about the issue. We had this issue with the smoke most of this year and NOT A SINGLE person had come to our apartment to check out the issue until we finally just went over the property&amp;apos;s head to the District Manager yet again. The new DM finally pushed for our apartment to get looked at 1.5 years later. The construction guy for our property checked out our apartment and the smoking neighbor&amp;apos;s apartment and acknowledged that the marijuana was from the neighbors. He sealed around the pipes which was a 5 minute fix and it has actually helped now. FIVE MINUTES!!!!! That is all the time tit took to fix the issue after 1.5 years. This could have been taken care of months and months ago if only this complex cared about it&amp;apos;s tenants to actually come inspect the problem. So, I stated I wanted compensation for the year and a half of neglect, the copious amounts of cleaners and air fresheners we bought, the electricity and water used to constantly re-wash our bedding to get rid of the smell, and for the overall horrible experience. They offered us $500. $500 for 1.5 years of nonsense. What a slap in the face. They sent people to shampoo our carpets and one of the guys entered into our apartment without wearing a mask during this time of Covid-19 which potentially puts us at risk for infection. I have so many pictures of trash being strewn about, pictures of people smoking in this community, and pictures of how disgusting the breezeway gets from the valet trash guys. I would never recommend this community to anyone until they enforce the non-smoking policy in the lease and get people in the office who actually try to fix the problems of their tenants instead of making them feel insignificant.</td>\n",

I&amp;apos;ve been lived in Long Island City for more than 4 years, I lived couple buildings around the area, which they will give one to two FREE days for moving in. But Hayden don&amp;apos;t have this deal and both agents are not telling us before it. I tried to talked with their agent, to ask if I can get one day free to move in or I can pay for one extra day for moving, but not extra week, and I got refused by the reason of the lease had been finalized.That is super confusion part! We changed the move in day earlier AFTER we signed the lease,they allowed it, they are happy that we are paying money with we can move in earlier, so they allow us to changed without saying there is a fee. But we didn&amp;apos;t know it has a fee on it. After we know it, we tried to changed the move-in date, they are not allowed us to do it. I don&amp;apos;t understand if they are has race on us because we are Asian or what kind of reason. There is many Asian live in LIC!! In the station of Covid-19, no one has extra money to offer, we tried to ask for their help to change for us, but they keep refused.</td>\n",

       "156  I am a current resident at this complex and let me just say, it has been the worst apartment living situation I have ever lived in. We moved in at the end of March 2019 and loved the apartment and the community. After 3 months, we began smelling marijuana in our apartment. Since this is a &quot;non smoking&quot; community, it was a bit of a shock to have our master bedroom and bathroom stinking from marijuana smell. So, I called and complained. The complex did what it always does which is to send a letter to each apartment saying not to smoke. Every month after that, we complained about the smell filling our apartment. In September of 2019 we were still having the issue and the complex would never come to actually check out the problem. Finally it got so bad that after numerous complaints, the complex decided to evict our neighbors months later. The neighbors somehow found out we complained and vandalized our vehicles. They broke my windshield on my car and also the side mirror of my partner&apos;s car. This was allowed to occur because the complex gave the tenants a week to move instead of just taking care of it right away. We had to call the police and file a report. At this point, I had had enough and went into the office to complain. The manager at the time offered no help whatsoever so I had to go to the District Manager to finally get results. After the neighbors got evicted, that apartment was empty for a month or 2 and we did not have the smoke problem. Then after getting new neighbors, we had the same problem. Our bathroom and bedroom began smelling of marijuana. We complained and got the usual response of &quot;we&apos;ll send a letter and call&quot;.

I tried to talked with their agent, to ask if I can get one day free to move in or I can pay for one extra day for moving, but not extra week, and I got refused by the reason of the lease had been finalized.That is super confusion part! We changed the move in day earlier AFTER we signed the lease,they allowed it, they are happy that we are paying money with we can move in earlier, so they allow us to changed without saying there is a fee. But we didn&apos;t know it has a fee on it. After we know it, we tried to changed the move-in date, they are not allowed us to do it. I don&apos;t understand if they are has race on us because we are Asian or what kind of reason. There is many Asian live in LIC!! In the station of Covid-19, no one has extra money to offer, we tried to ask for their help to change for us, but they keep refused.   \n",

Here is the link to just a few of the news articles I found detailing multiple code violations, failed HUD inspections, and numerous lawsuits alleging dangerous living conditions. https:// https:// https://dallasprogress. Rene Campos Jr., President- 46, lives in a $1 million-dollar home in University Park. He owns a $4 million-dollar vacation property Hawaii. He also plays polo, rides a custom motorcycle, and drives a Land Rover. Yet is referred to as a Slumlord more concerned with maximizing his income by holding down expenses selecting the least expensive bids often using unlicensed contractors and necessary permits rather than fulfilling tenants living commitments. On top of the failed inspections, code violations, Rene was also fined for failing to file 3 CONCECUTIVE YEARS of audited financial statements on time blaming &amp;quot;inattentiveness&amp;quot; by his accountants. To consider this companies &amp;quot;Code of Ethics&amp;quot; to be lacking would be modest. The multifamily industry depends on professional staff who routinely enter apartment homes, handle confidential information and carry out financial transactions. Multifamily owners and operators check criminal backgrounds to help protect the safety and security of residents and staff and to reduce the risk of violence, theft and fraud. However, Eureka hires unlicensed contractors to complete construction, renovations, electrical repairs requiring A License Contractor and Permits pulled by the city to approve the work prior to/ in progress/ upon completion. Due to the short cuts and shady business dealings more often than not the project goes incomplete or not meeting standards. That&amp;apos;s if the contractor doesn&amp;apos;t walk of the job for non-payment. Rene blames delayed repairs, incomplete projects, and non-payment on reluctant insurance carriers for his lack of financial resources. (Reluctant is a mild term… the insurance carriers are fighting fraudulent claims on repairs/damages persisting prior to Hurricane Harvey they are seeking funds for.) I was even able to find reviews from previous employees describing the unprofessional &amp; unsafe work environment. The high turnover could be in part to another unsafe attempt on expenses. I think this is what I found to be the most disturbing of all. Eureka has a 30-day probation period for new hires giving them the status of &amp;quot;Contract Labor&amp;quot;. Common practice in Multi-Family Housing right?? WRONG!! &amp;quot;Contract Employee&amp;quot; status DOES NOT REQUIRE A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK!! Meaning your friendly maintenance team may or may not be a convicted felon. Eureka picked up the unethical practice to cure the constant staff turnover, cost of screening multiples, and only paying &amp;quot;Contract Employee&amp;quot; straight-time for anything exceeding 80 hours avoiding costly overtime expense. Bottom line is this owner continues to make millions despite repeated contract violations, failure to maintain &amp;quot;safe, decent, sanitary living conditions&amp;quot;, and continued failure to file required financial statements on time each year. It&amp;apos;s no surprise Eureka has come under relentless attacks by critics alleging fraud when it&amp;apos;s clear they continue turning a profit by short-changing residents, employees, contractors, etc. The facts are in black in white! Think twice before you engage with this owner or company.</td>\n",

The multifamily industry depends on professional staff who routinely enter apartment homes, handle confidential information and carry out financial transactions. Multifamily owners and operators check criminal backgrounds to help protect the safety and security of residents and staff and to reduce the risk of violence, theft and fraud. However, Eureka hires unlicensed contractors to complete construction, renovations, electrical repairs requiring A License Contractor and Permits pulled by the city to approve the work prior to/ in progress/ upon completion. Due to the short cuts and shady business dealings more often than not the project goes incomplete or not meeting standards. That&amp;apos;s if the contractor doesn&amp;apos;t walk of the job for non-payment. Rene blames delayed repairs, incomplete projects, and non-payment on reluctant insurance carriers for his lack of financial resources. (Reluctant is a mild term… the insurance carriers are fighting fraudulent claims on repairs/damages persisting prior to Hurricane Harvey they are seeking funds for.) I was even able to find reviews from previous employees describing the unprofessional &amp; unsafe work environment. The high turnover could be in part to another unsafe attempt on expenses. I think this is what I found to be the most disturbing of all. Eureka has a 30-day probation period for new hires giving them the status of &amp;quot;Contract Labor&amp;quot;. Common practice in Multi-Family Housing right?? WRONG!! &amp;quot;Contract Employee&amp;quot; status DOES NOT REQUIRE A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK!! Meaning your friendly maintenance team may or may not be a convicted felon. Eureka picked up the unethical practice to cure the constant staff turnover, cost of screening multiples, and only paying &amp;quot;Contract Employee&amp;quot; straight-time for anything exceeding 80 hours avoiding costly overtime expense. Bottom line is this owner continues to make millions despite repeated contract violations, failure to maintain &amp;quot;safe, decent, sanitary living conditions&amp;quot;, and continued failure to file required financial statements on time each year. It&amp;apos;s no surprise Eureka has come under relentless attacks by critics alleging fraud when it&amp;apos;s clear they continue turning a profit by short-changing residents, employees, contractors, etc. The facts are in black in white! Think twice before you engage with this owner or company.</td>\n",

Occasionally you can see the children playing with the geese&#44; hoping that they&#39;ll fetch the large stick they hurl towards them.  Not only do I get the honor of seeing and hearing this comradery on a weekend afternoon or evening&#44; but if I&#39;m lucky enough I get to see and hear it on a weekend morning!!!!\\n\\nAnd let me not forget the emaciated looking man in front of building six that sits (and sometimes) sleeps in his truck.  Occasionally you can see him sitting in there talking to himself&#44; but if he gets the urge to enjoy the landscape he can be seen taking a smoke outside of his truck having a wonderful conversation with no other than himself!\\n\\nSigh... there&#39;s no place like home....  \n",

       "13775  Renter&apos;s, Employee&apos;s, Contractor&apos;s BEWARE of Eureka&apos;s Business Practices As a business owner, and renter myself I felt compelled to share the disturbing things I&apos;ve experienced and uncovered concerning this company and owner. Here is the link to just a few of the news articles I found detailing multiple code violations, failed HUD inspections, and numerous lawsuits alleging dangerous living conditions. https:// https:// https://dallasprogress. Rene Campos Jr., President- 46, lives in a $1 million-dollar home in University Park. He owns a $4 million-dollar vacation property Hawaii. He also plays polo, rides a custom motorcycle, and drives a Land Rover. Yet is referred to as a Slumlord more concerned with maximizing his income by holding down expenses selecting the least expensive bids often using unlicensed contractors and necessary permits rather than fulfilling tenants living commitments. On top of the failed inspections, code violations, Rene was also fined for failing to file 3 CONCECUTIVE YEARS of audited financial statements on time blaming &quot;inattentiveness&quot; by his accountants. To consider this companies &quot;Code of Ethics&quot; to be lacking would be modest. The multifamily industry depends on professional staff who routinely enter apartment homes, handle confidential information and carry out financial transactions. Multifamily owners and operators check criminal backgrounds to help protect the safety and security of residents and staff and to reduce the risk of violence, theft and fraud. However, Eureka hires unlicensed contractors to complete construction, renovations, electrical repairs requiring A License Contractor and Permits pulled by the city to approve the work prior to/ in progress/ upon completion. Due to the short cuts and shady business dealings more often than not the project goes incomplete or not meeting standards. That&apos;s if the contractor doesn&apos;t walk of the job for non-payment. Rene blames delayed repairs, incomplete projects, and non-payment on reluctant insurance carriers for his lack of financial resources. (Reluctant is a mild term… the insurance carriers are fighting fraudulent claims on repairs/damages persisting prior to Hurricane Harvey they are seeking funds for.) I was even able to find reviews from previous employees describing the unprofessional & unsafe work environment. The high turnover could be in part to another unsafe attempt on expenses. I think this is what I found to be the most disturbing of all. Eureka has a 30-day probation period for new hires giving them the status of &quot;Contract Labor&quot;. Common practice in Multi-Family Housing right?? WRONG!! &quot;Contract Employee&quot; status DOES NOT REQUIRE A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK!! Meaning your friendly maintenance team may or may not be a convicted felon. Eureka picked up the unethical practice to cure the constant staff turnover, cost of screening multiples, and only paying &quot;Contract Employee&quot; straight-time for anything exceeding 80 hours avoiding costly overtime expense. Bottom line is this owner continues to make millions despite repeated contract violations, failure to maintain &quot;safe, decent, sanitary living conditions&quot;, and continued failure to file required financial statements on time each year. It&apos;s no surprise Eureka has come under relentless attacks by critics alleging fraud when it&apos;s clear they continue turning a profit by short-changing residents, employees, contractors, etc. The facts are in black in white! Think twice before you engage with this owner or company.  \n",

Rene Campos Jr., President- 46, lives in a $1 million-dollar home in University Park. He owns a $4 million-dollar vacation property Hawaii. He also plays polo, rides a custom motorcycle, and drives a Land Rover. Yet is referred to as a Slumlord more concerned with maximizing his income by holding down expenses selecting the least expensive bids often using unlicensed contractors and necessary permits rather than fulfilling tenants living commitments. On top of the failed inspections, code violations, Rene was also fined for failing to file 3 CONCECUTIVE YEARS of audited financial statements on time blaming &quot;inattentiveness&quot; by his accountants. To consider this companies &quot;Code of Ethics&quot; to be lacking would be modest. The multifamily industry depends on professional staff who routinely enter apartment homes, handle confidential information and carry out financial transactions. Multifamily owners and operators check criminal backgrounds to help protect the safety and security of residents and staff and to reduce the risk of violence, theft and fraud. However, Eureka hires unlicensed contractors to complete construction, renovations, electrical repairs requiring A License Contractor and Permits pulled by the city to approve the work prior to/ in progress/ upon completion. Due to the short cuts and shady business dealings more often than not the project goes incomplete or not meeting standards. That&apos;s if the contractor doesn&apos;t walk of the job for non-payment. Rene blames delayed repairs, incomplete projects, and non-payment on reluctant insurance carriers for his lack of financial resources. (Reluctant is a mild term… the insurance carriers are fighting fraudulent claims on repairs/damages persisting prior to Hurricane Harvey they are seeking funds for.) I was even able to find reviews from previous employees describing the unprofessional & unsafe work environment. The high turnover could be in part to another unsafe attempt on expenses. I think this is what I found to be the most disturbing of all. Eureka has a 30-day probation period for new hires giving them the status of &quot;Contract Labor&quot;. Common practice in Multi-Family Housing right?? WRONG!! &quot;Contract Employee&quot; status DOES NOT REQUIRE A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK!! Meaning your friendly maintenance team may or may not be a convicted felon. Eureka picked up the unethical practice to cure the constant staff turnover, cost of screening multiples, and only paying &quot;Contract Employee&quot; straight-time for anything exceeding 80 hours avoiding costly overtime expense. Bottom line is this owner continues to make millions despite repeated contract violations, failure to maintain &quot;safe, decent, sanitary living conditions&quot;, and continued failure to file required financial statements on time each year. It&apos;s no surprise Eureka has come under relentless attacks by critics alleging fraud when it&apos;s clear they continue turning a profit by short-changing residents, employees, contractors, etc. The facts are in black in white! Think twice before you engage with this owner or company.  \n",

He also plays polo, rides a custom motorcycle, and drives a Land Rover. Yet is referred to as a Slumlord more concerned with maximizing his income by holding down expenses selecting the least expensive bids often using unlicensed contractors and necessary permits rather than fulfilling tenants living commitments. On top of the failed inspections, code violations, Rene was also fined for failing to file 3 CONCECUTIVE YEARS of audited financial statements on time blaming &amp;quot;inattentiveness&amp;quot; by his accountants. To consider this companies &amp;quot;Code of Ethics&amp;quot; to be lacking would be modest. The multifamily industry depends on professional staff who routinely enter apartment homes, handle confidential information and carry out financial transactions. Multifamily owners and operators check criminal backgrounds to help protect the safety and security of residents and staff and to reduce the risk of violence, theft and fraud. However, Eureka hires unlicensed contractors to complete construction, renovations, electrical repairs requiring A License Contractor and Permits pulled by the city to approve the work prior to/ in progress/ upon completion. Due to the short cuts and shady business dealings more often than not the project goes incomplete or not meeting standards. That&amp;apos;s if the contractor doesn&amp;apos;t walk of the job for non-payment. Rene blames delayed repairs, incomplete projects, and non-payment on reluctant insurance carriers for his lack of financial resources. (Reluctant is a mild term… the insurance carriers are fighting fraudulent claims on repairs/damages persisting prior to Hurricane Harvey they are seeking funds for.) I was even able to find reviews from previous employees describing the unprofessional &amp; unsafe work environment. The high turnover could be in part to another unsafe attempt on expenses. I think this is what I found to be the most disturbing of all. Eureka has a 30-day probation period for new hires giving them the status of &amp;quot;Contract Labor&amp;quot;. Common practice in Multi-Family Housing right?? WRONG!! &amp;quot;Contract Employee&amp;quot; status DOES NOT REQUIRE A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK!! Meaning your friendly maintenance team may or may not be a convicted felon. Eureka picked up the unethical practice to cure the constant staff turnover, cost of screening multiples, and only paying &amp;quot;Contract Employee&amp;quot; straight-time for anything exceeding 80 hours avoiding costly overtime expense. Bottom line is this owner continues to make millions despite repeated contract violations, failure to maintain &amp;quot;safe, decent, sanitary living conditions&amp;quot;, and continued failure to file required financial statements on time each year. It&amp;apos;s no surprise Eureka has come under relentless attacks by critics alleging fraud when it&amp;apos;s clear they continue turning a profit by short-changing residents, employees, contractors, etc. The facts are in black in white!

Here is the link to just a few of the news articles I found detailing multiple code violations, failed HUD inspections, and numerous lawsuits alleging dangerous living conditions. https:// https:// https://dallasprogress. Rene Campos Jr., President- 46, lives in a $1 million-dollar home in University Park. He owns a $4 million-dollar vacation property Hawaii. He also plays polo, rides a custom motorcycle, and drives a Land Rover. Yet is referred to as a Slumlord more concerned with maximizing his income by holding down expenses selecting the least expensive bids often using unlicensed contractors and necessary permits rather than fulfilling tenants living commitments. On top of the failed inspections, code violations, Rene was also fined for failing to file 3 CONCECUTIVE YEARS of audited financial statements on time blaming &amp;quot;inattentiveness&amp;quot; by his accountants. To consider this companies &amp;quot;Code of Ethics&amp;quot; to be lacking would be modest. The multifamily industry depends on professional staff who routinely enter apartment homes, handle confidential information and carry out financial transactions. Multifamily owners and operators check criminal backgrounds to help protect the safety and security of residents and staff and to reduce the risk of violence, theft and fraud. However, Eureka hires unlicensed contractors to complete construction, renovations, electrical repairs requiring A License Contractor and Permits pulled by the city to approve the work prior to/ in progress/ upon completion. Due to the short cuts and shady business dealings more often than not the project goes incomplete or not meeting standards. That&amp;apos;s if the contractor doesn&amp;apos;t walk of the job for non-payment. Rene blames delayed repairs, incomplete projects, and non-payment on reluctant insurance carriers for his lack of financial resources. (Reluctant is a mild term… the insurance carriers are fighting fraudulent claims on repairs/damages persisting prior to Hurricane Harvey they are seeking funds for.) I was even able to find reviews from previous employees describing the unprofessional &amp; unsafe work environment. The high turnover could be in part to another unsafe attempt on expenses. I think this is what I found to be the most disturbing of all. Eureka has a 30-day probation period for new hires giving them the status of &amp;quot;Contract Labor&amp;quot;. Common practice in Multi-Family Housing right?? WRONG!! &amp;quot;Contract Employee&amp;quot; status DOES NOT REQUIRE A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK!! Meaning your friendly maintenance team may or may not be a convicted felon. Eureka picked up the unethical practice to cure the constant staff turnover, cost of screening multiples, and only paying &amp;quot;Contract Employee&amp;quot; straight-time for anything exceeding 80 hours avoiding costly overtime expense. Bottom line is this owner continues to make millions despite repeated contract violations, failure to maintain &amp;quot;safe, decent, sanitary living conditions&amp;quot;, and continued failure to file required financial statements on time each year. It&amp;apos;s no surprise Eureka has come under relentless attacks by critics alleging fraud when it&amp;apos;s clear they continue turning a profit by short-changing residents, employees, contractors, etc. The facts are in black in white! Think twice before you engage with this owner or company.</td>\n",

       "      <td>NEVER EVER RECOMMENDED !!!!!!! There is no option for a NEGATIVE RATING, had to give one. If you want to be completely miserable and absolutely HATE where you live, deal with miscommunication, and live in a N---- Camp, this is the place for you! I rather sleep in a homeless HIV tuberculosis ridden dump than do this again. This is not the place you get for what you are paying. We signed up for 6 month lease and vacated the place. After vacating, we were surprised to see huge fines for which they give blabber reasons. They don&amp;apos;t mention few things at the time of inspection which is done at the time of vacating the place even though every thing looks great and clean. They come up with some damage and charge you for that. We were hugely charged for roach treatment and carpet replacement. There are no proofs for any of those. In the first place, the treatment cost wouldn&amp;apos;t have been huge. If asked for invoice, they charge more for producing invoice. Charging for Carpet replacement is something which blown our mind. They charged for carpet replacement as 9 month lease. Even, there was nothing mentioned at the time of inspection regarding that. As far as maintenance issues considered, it takes lots of weeks to get solved which is just pain in the ass. Leasing consultants doesn&amp;apos;t respond in helpful manner. When ever something comes up they are not ready to take it on their side or get it solved instead of that arguing takes place and simply say we are not responsible or contact some XYZ. We felt like we were helpless in those situations and hands were tied. Generally, people bear fines if things got worse or that would have been done by them. No one will be hesitating to clear the fines for that type of things. Even though charges are made when there is no resident&amp;apos;s fault, that doesn&amp;apos;t look fair. It&amp;apos;s managements responsibility to take care of things for next new resident instead of blindly charging the existing resident. The overall experience was a nightmare and would suggest others to be cautious before you take any move to step in or else &amp;quot;GET SET READY for some huge fines&amp;quot;. There are no PROS as far as I experienced. Cons: Management is very lazy, Issues doesn&amp;apos;t get solve, HUGE FINES</td>\n",

Occasionally you can see the children playing with the geese&#44; hoping that they&#39;ll fetch the large stick they hurl towards them.

Occasionally you can see the children playing with the geese&#44; hoping that they&#39;ll fetch the large stick they hurl towards them.

       "13775  Renter&apos;s, Employee&apos;s, Contractor&apos;s BEWARE of Eureka&apos;s Business Practices As a business owner, and renter myself I felt compelled to share the disturbing things I&apos;ve experienced and uncovered concerning this company and owner. Here is the link to just a few of the news articles I found detailing multiple code violations, failed HUD inspections, and numerous lawsuits alleging dangerous living conditions. https:// https:// https://dallasprogress. Rene Campos Jr., President- 46, lives in a $1 million-dollar home in University Park. He owns a $4 million-dollar vacation property Hawaii. He also plays polo, rides a custom motorcycle, and drives a Land Rover. Yet is referred to as a Slumlord more concerned with maximizing his income by holding down expenses selecting the least expensive bids often using unlicensed contractors and necessary permits rather than fulfilling tenants living commitments. On top of the failed inspections, code violations, Rene was also fined for failing to file 3 CONCECUTIVE YEARS of audited financial statements on time blaming &quot;inattentiveness&quot; by his accountants. To consider this companies &quot;Code of Ethics&quot; to be lacking would be modest. The multifamily industry depends on professional staff who routinely enter apartment homes, handle confidential information and carry out financial transactions. Multifamily owners and operators check criminal backgrounds to help protect the safety and security of residents and staff and to reduce the risk of violence, theft and fraud. However, Eureka hires unlicensed contractors to complete construction, renovations, electrical repairs requiring A License Contractor and Permits pulled by the city to approve the work prior to/ in progress/ upon completion. Due to the short cuts and shady business dealings more often than not the project goes incomplete or not meeting standards. That&apos;s if the contractor doesn&apos;t walk of the job for non-payment. Rene blames delayed repairs, incomplete projects, and non-payment on reluctant insurance carriers for his lack of financial resources. (Reluctant is a mild term… the insurance carriers are fighting fraudulent claims on repairs/damages persisting prior to Hurricane Harvey they are seeking funds for.) I was even able to find reviews from previous employees describing the unprofessional & unsafe work environment. The high turnover could be in part to another unsafe attempt on expenses. I think this is what I found to be the most disturbing of all. Eureka has a 30-day probation period for new hires giving them the status of &quot;Contract Labor&quot;. Common practice in Multi-Family Housing right?? WRONG!! &quot;Contract Employee&quot; status DOES NOT REQUIRE A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK!! Meaning your friendly maintenance team may or may not be a convicted felon. Eureka picked up the unethical practice to cure the constant staff turnover, cost of screening multiples, and only paying &quot;Contract Employee&quot; straight-time for anything exceeding 80 hours avoiding costly overtime expense. Bottom line is this owner continues to make millions despite repeated contract violations, failure to maintain &quot;safe, decent, sanitary living conditions&quot;, and continued failure to file required financial statements on time each year. It&apos;s no surprise Eureka has come under relentless attacks by critics alleging fraud when it&apos;s clear they continue turning a profit by short-changing residents, employees, contractors, etc. The facts are in black in white! Think twice before you engage with this owner or company.  \n",

Rene Campos Jr., President- 46, lives in a $1 million-dollar home in University Park. He owns a $4 million-dollar vacation property Hawaii. He also plays polo, rides a custom motorcycle, and drives a Land Rover. Yet is referred to as a Slumlord more concerned with maximizing his income by holding down expenses selecting the least expensive bids often using unlicensed contractors and necessary permits rather than fulfilling tenants living commitments. On top of the failed inspections, code violations, Rene was also fined for failing to file 3 CONCECUTIVE YEARS of audited financial statements on time blaming &quot;inattentiveness&quot; by his accountants. To consider this companies &quot;Code of Ethics&quot; to be lacking would be modest. The multifamily industry depends on professional staff who routinely enter apartment homes, handle confidential information and carry out financial transactions. Multifamily owners and operators check criminal backgrounds to help protect the safety and security of residents and staff and to reduce the risk of violence, theft and fraud. However, Eureka hires unlicensed contractors to complete construction, renovations, electrical repairs requiring A License Contractor and Permits pulled by the city to approve the work prior to/ in progress/ upon completion. Due to the short cuts and shady business dealings more often than not the project goes incomplete or not meeting standards. That&apos;s if the contractor doesn&apos;t walk of the job for non-payment. Rene blames delayed repairs, incomplete projects, and non-payment on reluctant insurance carriers for his lack of financial resources. (Reluctant is a mild term… the insurance carriers are fighting fraudulent claims on repairs/damages persisting prior to Hurricane Harvey they are seeking funds for.) I was even able to find reviews from previous employees describing the unprofessional & unsafe work environment. The high turnover could be in part to another unsafe attempt on expenses. I think this is what I found to be the most disturbing of all. Eureka has a 30-day probation period for new hires giving them the status of &quot;Contract Labor&quot;. Common practice in Multi-Family Housing right?? WRONG!! &quot;Contract Employee&quot; status DOES NOT REQUIRE A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK!! Meaning your friendly maintenance team may or may not be a convicted felon. Eureka picked up the unethical practice to cure the constant staff turnover, cost of screening multiples, and only paying &quot;Contract Employee&quot; straight-time for anything exceeding 80 hours avoiding costly overtime expense. Bottom line is this owner continues to make millions despite repeated contract violations, failure to maintain &quot;safe, decent, sanitary living conditions&quot;, and continued failure to file required financial statements on time each year. It&apos;s no surprise Eureka has come under relentless attacks by critics alleging fraud when it&apos;s clear they continue turning a profit by short-changing residents, employees, contractors, etc. The facts are in black in white! Think twice before you engage with this owner or company.  \n",

There is no option for a NEGATIVE RATING, had to give one. If you want to be completely miserable and absolutely HATE where you live, deal with miscommunication, and live in a N---- Camp, this is the place for you! I rather sleep in a homeless HIV tuberculosis ridden dump than do this again. This is not the place you get for what you are paying. We signed up for 6 month lease and vacated the place. After vacating, we were surprised to see huge fines for which they give blabber reasons. They don&apos;t mention few things at the time of inspection which is done at the time of vacating the place even though every thing looks great and clean. They come up with some damage and charge you for that. We were hugely charged for roach treatment and carpet replacement. There are no proofs for any of those. In the first place, the treatment cost wouldn&apos;t have been huge. If asked for invoice, they charge more for producing invoice. Charging for Carpet replacement is something which blown our mind. They charged for carpet replacement as 9 month lease. Even, there was nothing mentioned at the time of inspection regarding that. As far as maintenance issues considered, it takes lots of weeks to get solved which is just pain in the ass. Leasing consultants doesn&apos;t respond in helpful manner. When ever something comes up they are not ready to take it on their side or get it solved instead of that arguing takes place and simply say we are not responsible or contact some XYZ. We felt like we were helpless in those situations and hands were tied. Generally, people bear fines if things got worse or that would have been done by them. No one will be hesitating to clear the fines for that type of things. Even though charges are made when there is no resident&apos;s fault, that doesn&apos;t look fair. It&apos;s managements responsibility to take care of things for next new resident instead of blindly charging the existing resident. The overall experience was a nightmare and would suggest others to be cautious before you take any move to step in or else &quot;GET SET READY for some huge fines&quot;. There are no PROS as far as I experienced. Cons: Management is very lazy, Issues doesn&apos;t get solve, HUGE FINES  \n",

They don&apos;t mention few things at the time of inspection which is done at the time of vacating the place even though every thing looks great and clean.

In the first place, the treatment cost wouldn&apos;t have been huge. If asked for invoice, they charge more for producing invoice. Charging for Carpet replacement is something which blown our mind. They charged for carpet replacement as 9 month lease. Even, there was nothing mentioned at the time of inspection regarding that. As far as maintenance issues considered, it takes lots of weeks to get solved which is just pain in the ass. Leasing consultants doesn&apos;t respond in helpful manner. When ever something comes up they are not ready to take it on their side or get it solved instead of that arguing takes place and simply say we are not responsible or contact some XYZ. We felt like we were helpless in those situations and hands were tied. Generally, people bear fines if things got worse or that would have been done by them. No one will be hesitating to clear the fines for that type of things. Even though charges are made when there is no resident&apos;s fault, that doesn&apos;t look fair.

(reluctant is a mild term… the insurance carriers are fighting fraudulent claims on repairs/damages persisting prior to hurricane harvey they are seeking funds for.) i was even able to find reviews from previous employees describing the unprofessional &amp; unsafe work environment. the high turnover could be in part to another unsafe attempt on expenses. i think this is what i found to be the most disturbing of all. eureka has a 30-day probation period for new hires giving them the status of \"contract labor\". common practice in multi-family housing right?? wrong!! \"contract employee\" status does not require a criminal background check!! meaning your friendly maintenance team may or may not be a convicted felon. eureka picked up the unethical practice to cure the constant staff turnover, cost of screening multiples, and only paying \"contract employee\" straight-time for anything exceeding 80 hours avoiding costly overtime expense. bottom line is this owner continues to make millions despite repeated contract violations, failure to maintain \"safe, decent, sanitary living conditions\", and continued failure to file required financial statements on time each year. it's no surprise eureka has come under relentless attacks by critics alleging fraud when it's clear they continue turning a profit by short-changing residents, employees, contractors, etc. the facts are in black in white! think twice before you engage with this owner or company.</td>\n",

       "6  renter's, employee's, contractor's beware of eureka's business practices as a business owner, and renter myself i felt compelled to share the disturbing things i've experienced and uncovered concerning this company and owner. here is the link to just a few of the news articles i found detailing multiple code violations, failed hud inspections, and numerous lawsuits alleging dangerous living conditions. https:// https:// https://dallasprogress. rene campos jr., president- 46, lives in a $1 million-dollar home in university park. he owns a $4 million-dollar vacation property hawaii. he also plays polo, rides a custom motorcycle, and drives a land rover. yet is referred to as a slumlord more concerned with maximizing his income by holding down expenses selecting the least expensive bids often using unlicensed contractors and necessary permits rather than fulfilling tenants living commitments. on top of the failed inspections, code violations, rene was also fined for failing to file 3 concecutive years of audited financial statements on time blaming \"inattentiveness\" by his accountants. to consider this companies \"code of ethics\" to be lacking would be modest. the multifamily industry depends on professional staff who routinely enter apartment homes, handle confidential information and carry out financial transactions. multifamily owners and operators check criminal backgrounds to help protect the safety and security of residents and staff and to reduce the risk of violence, theft and fraud. however, eureka hires unlicensed contractors to complete construction, renovations, electrical repairs requiring a license contractor and permits pulled by the city to approve the work prior to/ in progress/ upon completion. due to the short cuts and shady business dealings more often than not the project goes incomplete or not meeting standards. that's if the contractor doesn't walk of the job for non-payment. rene blames delayed repairs, incomplete projects, and non-payment on reluctant insurance carriers for his lack of financial resources. (reluctant is a mild term… the insurance carriers are fighting fraudulent claims on repairs/damages persisting prior to hurricane harvey they are seeking funds for.) i was even able to find reviews from previous employees describing the unprofessional & unsafe work environment. the high turnover could be in part to another unsafe attempt on expenses. i think this is what i found to be the most disturbing of all. eureka has a 30-day probation period for new hires giving them the status of \"contract labor\". common practice in multi-family housing right?? wrong!! \"contract employee\" status does not require a criminal background check!! meaning your friendly maintenance team may or may not be a convicted felon. eureka picked up the unethical practice to cure the constant staff turnover, cost of screening multiples, and only paying \"contract employee\" straight-time for anything exceeding 80 hours avoiding costly overtime expense. bottom line is this owner continues to make millions despite repeated contract violations, failure to maintain \"safe, decent, sanitary living conditions\", and continued failure to file required financial statements on time each year. it's no surprise eureka has come under relentless attacks by critics alleging fraud when it's clear they continue turning a profit by short-changing residents, employees, contractors, etc. the facts are in black in white! think twice before you engage with this owner or company.   \n",

       "6492  Please ignore the idiotic negative reviews. I&apos;m on my 6th lease here and I love this place. I run the social group here as well and we&apos;ve turned this place into a community. It&apos;s amazing and several of us have already renewed again or are about to because of how much we enjoy it. There is a detention center nearby which is different than the &quot;max prison&quot; some people on here are describing. *eye roll* and you can only see it from one side of one of the FOUR buildings Carlyle has. It&apos;s really not a big deal. The staff is very friendly but then again I also TREAT them respectfully, therefore I receive the same respect in turn. Again, ignore the really dumb reviews on here and take it from someone who is over halfway through her 6th lease...this place is epic.  "

Again, ignore the really dumb reviews on here and take it from someone who is over halfway through her 6th lease...this place is epic.</td>\n",

       "6492  Please ignore the idiotic negative reviews. I&apos;m on my 6th lease here and I love this place. I run the social group here as well and we&apos;ve turned this place into a community. It&apos;s amazing and several of us have already renewed again or are about to because of how much we enjoy it. There is a detention center nearby which is different than the &quot;max prison&quot; some people on here are describing. *eye roll* and you can only see it from one side of one of the FOUR buildings Carlyle has. It&apos;s really not a big deal. The staff is very friendly but then again I also TREAT them respectfully, therefore I receive the same respect in turn. Again, ignore the really dumb reviews on here and take it from someone who is over halfway through her 6th lease...this place is epic.  "

       "0  Initially I was excited about moving to Settlers Gate but the experience quickly soured. Shortly after being approved for the apartment and had paid all of the required fees to reserve the space, I was told that the date that was originally given to me to move was no longer available. They asked me to move a week away from the original date. They did not try to accommodate me with an alternative option since it was their error in the first place. Seeing that I am not from the area I asked for a refund to find a place that could accommodate the original move in date. I was told that I would have to wait 2-4 weeks to receive a full refund because the refund comes from corporate. Now I have to spend extra money on admin, app, and deposit fees because of their lack of professionalism with their scheduling move in dates. Also, one of the male staff members hung up in my face when I was expressing my concern about the situation and how it was handled. The price for this place is awesome but the lack of professionalism is not worth the hassle.   \n",

       "0  Initially I was excited about moving to Settlers Gate but the experience quickly soured. Shortly after being approved for the apartment and had paid all of the required fees to reserve the space, I was told that the date that was originally given to me to move was no longer available. They asked me to move a week away from the original date. They did not try to accommodate me with an alternative option since it was their error in the first place. Seeing that I am not from the area I asked for a refund to find a place that could accommodate the original move in date. I was told that I would have to wait 2-4 weeks to receive a full refund because the refund comes from corporate. Now I have to spend extra money on admin, app, and deposit fees because of their lack of professionalism with their scheduling move in dates. Also, one of the male staff members hung up in my face when I was expressing my concern about the situation and how it was handled. The price for this place is awesome but the lack of professionalism is not worth the hassle.   \n",
