As a current resident, I like the way the 3 BR apt was clean, with new carpet, a new cook stove and oven and a suitable kitchen floor, easily kept clean. The washer and dryer are good quality and although there were some problems with the dryer at first, the management called in some repairmen who knew what they were doing and it works fine now. The back sliding glass door tack did not work well and maintenance also took care of that problem quickly. The apartment is on the ground floor and water accumulates in the back, because it is not well drained.  The floors are concrete, so of course this leads to dampness, and we have had some serious mold problems, as well as swelling wood doors which would not close. I must say that the management sent maintenance to clean the mold from the lower walls and also provided us a dehumidifier, so now the doors will close again and the mold has not returned. We will watch, and if it does, we will quickly clean, as soon as it appears, rather than let it grow, as some other tenants apparently have.. The grass is kept well mowed, the dumpsters emptied in a timely fashion and the parking lot kept clean. There is adequate parking, although not reserved, and I sometimes have to park some distance away from my entrance. I like the pool, which is kept clean, although it is old and the pool furniture is not in good shape. Parking lots are adequately lighted at night.
      Although the quality of the  property is slightly above average, I think the rent is well also above average for this area ($720 for a 3 br - 2 bath), considering what we receive for it.

The back sliding glass door tack did not work well and maintenance also took care of that problem quickly. The apartment is on the ground floor and water accumulates in the back, because it is not well drained.  The floors are concrete, so of course this leads to dampness, and we have had some serious mold problems, as well as swelling wood doors which would not close. I must say that the management sent maintenance to clean the mold from the lower walls and also provided us a dehumidifier, so now the doors will close again and the mold has not returned. We will watch, and if it does, we will quickly clean, as soon as it appears, rather than let it grow, as some other tenants apparently have.. The grass is kept well mowed, the dumpsters emptied in a timely fashion and the parking lot kept clean. There is adequate parking, although not reserved, and I sometimes have to park some distance away from my entrance. I like the pool, which is kept clean, although it is old and the pool furniture is not in good shape. Parking lots are adequately lighted at night.
      Although the quality of the  property is slightly above average, I think the rent is well also above average for this area ($720 for a 3 br - 2 bath), considering what we receive for it.

659302,"I stumbled across this apartment ratings page while looking up my new apartment phone #. I decided to check what people had to say about Maple Ridge apartments, one of the craziest living environments i've ever had the misfortune to stumble into. Everything i have to say is absolutely true, and its been awhile, but i really want to share my personal experience. 
 On day 1, i arrived with my truck full of stuff. Marianne was not there. I could not move in as planned. Day 2, came back, it was raining. She was not there. At this point my mom said ""If she doesn't show up in the next 10 minutes, leave, i don't trust this place"" Marianne arrived to let me in after about an hour of waiting. I was in. While living there I was robbed twice by the maintenance man. I figured this out by doing my own investigation, asking who saw who by the apartment. When i told Marianne it was the maintenance man, she said ""Well, hes in jail right now, so theres nothing i can do"" filed a police report, but never saw that money again. I was yelled at numerous times for Having my trunk, and or car door open, usually while transporting groceries. One night, I lost something in my car, so i was out in the parking lot looking for my credit card in the seat, and i hadnt been looking for more than 3 minutes when i was Yelled at, with the threat of having the police called for being in my own vehicle. On anoter occasion i was yelled at for changing a simple taillight bulb. To remedy this, i drove out into the street, parked, changed it, and drove back into the lot. My girlfriend was yelled at if she left the laundry room while her clothes were drying. She was told she had to stay in the laundry room till the wash and dry cycle were complete. I was told my Girlfriend shouldnt smoke if shes pregnant. My girlfriend wasnt pregnant. ^^ I was told that I couldnt throw most of my trash away, somehow most trash was some kind of trash violation. My girlfriend would tell me that on days she was home from work, she would look out of the peep hole, and Mariane would be in the hall listening. My vehicle and my girlfriends vehicle were both robbed at one point, stereo, etc. The AC unit never worked in the apartment when it was hot out. At one point it took 2 weeks (hottest weeks by far) to be fixed. The explanation was ""A racoon must have died in it"" ^^ On another occasion the AC wasnt fixed, Marianne started crying about someone in her family as the reason. When i moved out, My friends who helped me where in shock and arguing with her cause she wouldnt let me throw anything away, I just told them ""You just have to just do it, and pretend shes not there"" During my stay, i never missed a rent payment, and was never more than 5 days late if that. I was a kind and courteous neighbor, who got along well with the other tennants. The day before i moved out I had my carpet steam cleaned, and did extensive cleaning to make sure there was no reason not to get back my security deposit.  I never received it. Also, when moving into my new apartments, Marianne would not return the information needed for the new place. When Marianne finally faxed back the info, she said that she would NOT recommend me as a renter anywhere, and that i was late 9 times on my rent, and missed payments. My new apartment manager laughed when my credit report showed a perfect payment schedule, and also said ""Don't worry, we have heard so many stories about Marianne, that we pretty much disregard anything she says."" If you're looking for a socially disturbing and paranoid/psychotic living experience, with no money back guarantee, then move in. Otherwise, live anywhere else.","I stumbled across this apartment ratings page while looking up my new apartment phone #.

Fourth of all my boyfriend and I wanted to get a pet to start a little fanily so we called somebody that workes in the office and asked if it was okay to have a dog and girl said yes it was so we went lollypop and bought a puppy. We called the manager of the complex the day after we got the puppy and asked when was a good time to drop off the $200 down deposit...she calls us back telling us that dogs are not allowed and apologized that we were misinformed from the previous girl because she was ""new"". All the manager said was that either we could find our puppy a second home or transfer to another apartment that would allow it with a $450 transfer fee. Thankgod we found the puppy a second home. The manager was not willing to talk things over at all over the phone or trying to negotiate anything especially because theres nothing in the lease agreement that says no pets allowed...Let alone the apartments are not up to date at all. The doors and windows are old and the kitchen cabinets are very old as well. Paying $675 a month with no utilities included is a little too pricey.

111761451,"There are ongoing pest problems in apartment units which includes yellow asian larvae/beetles, black carpet beetles, large black/brown spiders, box elder bugs, silverfish (in bathroom), etc.  As soon as spring hits, there's a large volume of wasps that swarm and nest all over the building as well as inside the AC unit--unfortunately with gaps/crevices in the patio door/window/AC wasps get inside your apartment unit OFTEN.  I do not doubt that there are mice in the apartment building as I have heard suspicious scratching in the walls and shenanigans behind fridge/oven, but never actually seen a mouse as of yet.  

The laundry room is usually dirty with laundry detergent spills, overflowing garbage, debris on floor, mildew smell in washing machines, etc.  Generally broken down washer/dryers take upwards of 4 months to get repaired,  When they do work, people overload washer which bangs loudly when unbalanced + then base of machines get loose and bang back and forth while washer in rinse cycle which is a perpetual noise nuisance to have to listen to....let alone it ruins the washers, since they do not get proactive preventative maintenance whatsoever.

Small children frequently get left poorly attended to and they scream, run up/down hallway, cry, and act a fool in shared areas at all hours.  Walls are not insulated and very thin so easily hear hallway/stairwell traffic noises, laundry room noise, neighbors lives which include their loud music, arguing, partying, etc.  Tenants do not respect the quiet ordinance and there are loud & obnoxious people all times of the day especially in the parking lot late at night and play area with unsupervised children &/or ill-mannered tweens which gets very annoying.  

There is a leaky roof so there is water that seeps through ceiling and walls so water drips directly into your apartment.  I have several water spots on wall/ceiling and very concerned with standing water/mold issues; I have to worry whenever it rains or snow melts that leaking will return.  There was ground flooding and the apartment building got a sealing around perimeter, but water still soaks underground garage/1st floor apartments. 

When police are called for crimes, management does not proactively post all notifications so tenants can be informed of safety issues.  The sign for the property is not lit at night so visitors will tend to drive past the entrance as cannot see it plus it is a safety concern when walking at night or early in morning when it is still dark.

Apartment manager is called with unit/building issues and he is usually dismissive, offers excuses/explanations, ignores/downplays concerns, etc. and suspect he is simply annoyed he has some work to do which is his job in being an apartment manager; this is quite frustrating and he can kind of be a jerk when you call too like you are bothering him.  When maintenance gets done by apartment manager, he seems to do the work half way plus makes a mess and sometimes a second or third call is needed because repair was not done effectively/correctly with right parts. He leaves your apartment unlocked for a period of time to wander off doing this and that while he is supposed to be fixing something. If a specialty repair is needed, any contractor just gets a key to your apartment with no Silver Bell Apartments staff in attendance to supervise which is completely unacceptable.

When I moved in, the carpet was not replaced which I had told it would be prior to my moving in.  Also, the apartment door was banged up and I was told it would be fixed prior to my moving in.  There are dents in the sliding closet door in bedroom and doors are not on track.  None of this was ever replaced/fixed.  The carpeting throughout the building is old, moldy, dirty, worn, and smells bad.  There is an ancient AC unit that barely cools living room and it is quite loud and very expensive to run.

This location is not convenient to utilize public transportation, if needed.

There is very hard water in the building and water softener does not appear to get used, so it takes very long time to rinse yourself clean of soap on skin and rinse shampoo/conditioner out of your hair. The skin is itchy because water is hard. The bathroom/kitchen faucets are encrusted with white substance buildup, due to hard water. Trying to clean both rooms is difficult because of the hard water buildup.

There is nice woods nearby and the outside apartment building is painted plus decorated with flowers/plants; however, the inside of the NOT just newly remodeled apartment units to rent out now at $1,006.00/month is a scathing contrast.  Existing tenants have leaking sinks and running toilets and crusty cabinets and gross carpet and collapsing cracks/walls disintegrating, water leaking from ceiling throughout the entire top floor including in the hallways/laundry room/inside apartment unit, etc. 

I hope this review helps everyone to make an informed choice to choose not to rent at Silver Bell Apartments in Eagan, MN. I sincerely believe this place is a dump especially considering what Silver Bell Apartments charges to rent an apartment unit.  The prior review is totally accurate in stating that this is an Eagan slum.  It isn't always easy to move out considering the aforementioned and I cannot afford to move out at this time.  I do not want anyone else to move here and have all these problems as well as the apartment manager's bad attitude to contend with.   Your private residence should be peaceful, safe, clean, reasonable, and a joy to live at.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO RENT AN APARTMENT HERE @ 2091-95 Silver Bell Road, Eagan, MN 55122.","There are ongoing pest problems in apartment units which includes yellow asian larvae/beetles, black carpet beetles, large black/brown spiders, box elder bugs, silverfish (in bathroom), etc.  As soon as spring hits, there&apos;s a large volume of wasps that swarm and nest all over the building as well as inside the AC unit--unfortunately with gaps/crevices in the patio door/window/AC wasps get inside your apartment unit OFTEN.  I do not doubt that there are mice in the apartment building as I have heard suspicious scratching in the walls and shenanigans behind fridge/oven, but never actually seen a mouse as of yet.

112691229,"These apartments are the price they are for a reason. Don't expect any frills. 

Negatives  - Roaches in apartments, management just sends a pest control company to spray the floors and baseboards so doesn't fix anything. Apartment AC units are poor. Very hot in the summer. They don't regularly change air filters and I'm sure the ducts havn't been cleaned in years. Management finally decided to replace roofs and insulation awhile back and when the company that did it showed up, they were shocked to find almost zero insulation in our buildings attic. They physically showed me and I was blown away I'd been living in a building with no insulation for a year. Our water has been turned off close to 30 times in the past year and a half so they can fix plumbing repairs in the area. Dumpsters.... are constantly full of trash which overflows onto the ground. Some of the tenants that live here can't even be bothered to put their trash in the dumpsters and just set it in the dumpster area, Ive watched them do it. The grounds are very poorly maintained. Lots of mud and dirt where grass should be. Lots of rust on railings and steps. Potholes in the parking lot that they never fix. Outsides of buildings and windows are not cleaned and need to be repainted. Management can't even provide working vending machines at the leasing office. Management often sends emails and newsletters riddled with grammatical errors. Professionalism is lacking. I don't personally understand why we recieve letters threatening fines if we have unapproved items on our porch when the grounds, buildings, and dumpster areas  seem poorly maintained. There are also several tenants around us who have no respect for noise pollution. Blaring subwoofers from people in the parking lot is annoying. Additionally I believe the companies hired to do work on the building are of poor quality. I was awoken by a roofer one day banging on my door, who seemed high out of his mind, almost completely unintelligible, and was swearing profusely about a car he needed moved. The workers for company who did the insulation were extremely unprofessional. Swearing constantly and and one kept saying he was going to quit his job. Please spend some more money and find professionals for jobs.

Positives - Location. Cheap for the square footage. Maintenance shows up very quickly and seems to be mostly competent. Roof replaced, and now we have insulation.

I previously worked in a management position for a supplier in the apartment industry in Oklahoma and surrounding states, so I've seen hundreds of apartment complexes. I've seen far far worse, but this complex needs alot of work and its sad nothing seems to be done about it.

Thank you in advance for reading my review.","These apartments are the price they are for a reason. Don't expect any frills. 

Negatives  - Roaches in apartments, management just sends a pest control company to spray the floors and baseboards so doesn't fix anything. Apartment AC units are poor. Very hot in the summer. They don't regularly change air filters and I'm sure the ducts havn't been cleaned in years. Management finally decided to replace roofs and insulation awhile back and when the company that did it showed up, they were shocked to find almost zero insulation in our buildings attic. They physically showed me and I was blown away I'd been living in a building with no insulation for a year. Our water has been turned off close to 30 times in the past year and a half so they can fix plumbing repairs in the area. Dumpsters.... are constantly full of trash which overflows onto the ground. Some of the tenants that live here can't even be bothered to put their trash in the dumpsters and just set it in the dumpster area, Ive watched them do it. The grounds are very poorly maintained. Lots of mud and dirt where grass should be. Lots of rust on railings and steps. Potholes in the parking lot that they never fix. Outsides of buildings and windows are not cleaned and need to be repainted. Management can't even provide working vending machines at the leasing office.

IT IS IN YOUR CONTACT THAT YOU MIST ALLOW THEM IN FOR ROUTINE INSPECTION. IF YOU ARE SLEEPING THEY WILL ENTER. YOU WILL BE FINED IF OTHERWISE. This goes for the janitorial team and the fire department. They will knock on the front door. If no one answers, they WILL enter. They will then begin checking each and every room as follows. First they knock, if you are sleeping or in the shower, they WILL enter. I can't tell you how many times I've had these men enter my room while I was undressed or suddenly shocked getting out of my shower to come to my door. This usually would take place around 8 AM before my morning classes. I would always wake up with strange men standing over me. PARENTS BEWARE READ YOUR CONTRACTS. THEY MUST AND WILL ENTER. Prior to the new cleaning and janitorial team, they had two mean who would mainly clean and service utilities. These men would open my door, my roommates doors (all female unit) and do their inspections because they had to. They are very impatient. I've even said before ""one second, let me get dressed"" and before I knew it, my door was wide open. Filled with men in dirty clothes and muddy boots with step ladders ready to check alarms and such. 2. Rates are going up and the units and services don't match. A lot of what you pay is going to the new security team they've hired also. They don't do their jobs. DO NOT LET HAWKS LANDING FOOL YOU PARENTS. They openly sit outside of the gate on their phones or sleep in their gold carts. Sometimes there is no one at the gate at all. Also, you MUST SIGN IN ALL GUESTS THAT WISH TO ENTER. Parents, siblings, friends, any and everyone that comes to your home they MUST SHOW ID AND FILL OUT A FORM WITH ALL INFORMATION AND HAVE THEIR PICTURES TAKEN. This is extremely invasive. The security are always rude and unwelcoming to my guests. All guests. Because they do not want to work. Half of them also don't even know the rules. So it depends on who you get that day. 3. Hawks Landing is completely roach infested, it is sickening to the point where units had to evacuate for emergency cleaning and bombing. 4. Administration is ALWAYS looking for reasons to up-charge you. They tack on new fees just because they can. I have had many strange charges on the monthly bill that I have had to call and dispute or go down to the font office. Just for a simple, ""sorry that was a mistake"". They know exactly what they are doing. It's just a matter or who catches it or not. They definitely take advantage of the fact that's there aren't many English speakers in HCC at Hawks Landing. 5.

Hawks landing is a prison and he's the guard. It's very odd and off putting. 6. Instead of feeling like a growing adult who pays rent and has a home. This places feels like a glorified high school.

112816197,"My favorite part is the monthly pest control. I've seen less than five bugs during my 1.5 years in my current apartment, which is amazing. The apartment is super nice and conveniently located. It's pretty highly priced, but considering the location and the fact that I rent a one bedroom, it's also a case of getting what you pay for. I've had no problems so far. One afternoon, a key was stuck in one of the building entrances and, after I called it in, it was gone by the evening. JSM does have a reputation for keeping at least half of the security deposit, so account for that or take lots of pictures when you move in and move out and document everything. It's a pretty common practice in the college town and most leasing companies will do it, so while it's slightly annoying, it's not a deal breaker for me since the company is otherwise great with support. Overall, I'd recommend JSM because, aside from the deposit issue, the company hasn't done anything scummy to me and are very reliable to contact.

112691229,"These apartments are the price they are for a reason. Don't expect any frills. 

Negatives  - Roaches in apartments, management just sends a pest control company to spray the floors and baseboards so doesn't fix anything. Apartment AC units are poor. Very hot in the summer. They don't regularly change air filters and I'm sure the ducts havn't been cleaned in years. Management finally decided to replace roofs and insulation awhile back and when the company that did it showed up, they were shocked to find almost zero insulation in our buildings attic. They physically showed me and I was blown away I'd been living in a building with no insulation for a year. Our water has been turned off close to 30 times in the past year and a half so they can fix plumbing repairs in the area. Dumpsters.... are constantly full of trash which overflows onto the ground. Some of the tenants that live here can't even be bothered to put their trash in the dumpsters and just set it in the dumpster area, Ive watched them do it. The grounds are very poorly maintained. Lots of mud and dirt where grass should be. Lots of rust on railings and steps. Potholes in the parking lot that they never fix. Outsides of buildings and windows are not cleaned and need to be repainted. Management can't even provide working vending machines at the leasing office. Management often sends emails and newsletters riddled with grammatical errors. Professionalism is lacking. I don't personally understand why we recieve letters threatening fines if we have unapproved items on our porch when the grounds, buildings, and dumpster areas  seem poorly maintained. There are also several tenants around us who have no respect for noise pollution. Blaring subwoofers from people in the parking lot is annoying. Additionally I believe the companies hired to do work on the building are of poor quality. I was awoken by a roofer one day banging on my door, who seemed high out of his mind, almost completely unintelligible, and was swearing profusely about a car he needed moved. The workers for company who did the insulation were extremely unprofessional. Swearing constantly and and one kept saying he was going to quit his job. Please spend some more money and find professionals for jobs.

Positives - Location. Cheap for the square footage. Maintenance shows up very quickly and seems to be mostly competent. Roof replaced, and now we have insulation.

I previously worked in a management position for a supplier in the apartment industry in Oklahoma and surrounding states, so I've seen hundreds of apartment complexes. I've seen far far worse, but this complex needs alot of work and its sad nothing seems to be done about it.

Thank you in advance for reading my review.","These apartments are the price they are for a reason. Don't expect any frills.

112799032,"**Rent at your own risk** After multiple failed attempts to get the staff to respond, I have to start by saying that I've had to reach out to Corporate. In fairness, I am giving Corporate a chance to make things right; however, that doesn't negate the fact that the staff they have hired to work this property now and in the past is negligent. I'm dealing with a confirmed case of mold, and no one has offered to see that we are safe in our living situation. The President of RECM Properties, Michele Liakos, called and stated they must see what is causing the mold issues but NEVER said that our health was a priority and concern. Never offered to relocate us while they investigate the problems. Never offered anything that would remove us from the area of the hazard. She wanted to send the same crew out to see the mold and issues more than three times now. The last time they came out, I requested they leave since I hired a mold specialist to test the apartment. You should NOT have to point out a hazardous looking substance more than three times before someone thinks, ""OH MAYBE WE SHOULD TEST THIS"" - That would be common sense. It would help if you did NOT have to pay to have someone check the apartment for someone to take you seriously. He took one of my Clorox wipes, wiped it away, and said he fixed the issue. I ask that sometimes people have empathy and do unto others as they want to be done to them. While I understand you may be upset that you have to keep coming out to the same apartment, if items are broken, fix it before leaving so you don't have to keep coming out. Lord only knows I don't want people running in and out of my apartment during the COVID. I don't like submitting work requests just as much as they don't like coming out. I've lived on-site for over three years now and have watched more than fifteen property managers & assistant property managers come and go. I can not even begin to count the number of maintenance personnel that has come through the property. Staffing and communication are HORRIBLE. When you see the staff running around fixing and repairing items and being nice, they have received word that Corporate is coming to the site to visit. Someone from another site location will call and give a heads up that Corporate is in the area. Also, the staff begs the residents to write excellent reviews. They have called around and requested us to write good reviews to get their ratings up. So when you see that influx of good ratings in the year 2020, know they've asked people to do that b/c Corporate reads your reviews, and they will get called out on it. I've worked in the office and experienced them getting the calls about the reviews. So with that being said, I will tell you about my experience. I feel it is essential to take the time to write REAL reviews when you get bad customer service and excellent customer service. I moved into the apartment in 2017. According to the lease under section 12, I conducted a walk-through of the apartment and noticed several things, which I reported to the main office. . The exhaust fan was not working in the bathroom (3 years later, it still hasn't been fixed. In fact, maintenance laughed and said you don't even have a fan in there. The whole fan was removed.) . The apartment was dirty and full of bugs and empty drink bottles and trash. . The cabinets had spots that showed heavy wear and were covered with paint that was close in color but not matching. (see picture below) . The sink was used to store paint/paint buckets and other items used by maintenance. There was white paint residue spilled all in the sink and on the countertops. The sink was also separating from the counter. (picture below) . Some of the window blinds were torn I immediately contacted the property manager to advise of all the issues in the apartment. I ultimately had to pay out of pocket to have the apartment cleaned before unpacking. Maintenance came over and tried to clean the paint residue but was unable and advised the sink would not be replaced. They also advised the cabinets would not be replaced, and they would come back to replace the blinds and the exhaust fan. Maintenance never came out to replace or fix any of the requested items. I asked them to fix the fan as it was imperative that the bathroom have adequate ventilation. Maintenance never replaced the fan. On 10/24/2018, I placed a work order and addressed the exhaust fan again. (See below taken from the maintenance request log on my portal). The comment reads, ""The exhaust fan in the bathroom still has not been fixed, which is allowing moisture build up in the bathroom."" A work order was placed: 10/24/2018 Plumbing Faucet in the bathroom shower is leaking and causing a daily build-up of hard water and staining on the shower curtain. There is also slow drainage causing the water to back up in the shower. The bathroom's exhaust fan still has not been fixed, allowing moisture to build up in the bathroom. On 11/30/2018, I placed a work order to have the blinds replaced, as there was a new maintenance crew on site. (Also addressed in the request; the exhaust fan) They came out and replaced the blinds immediately and stated they would have to have someone else look at the exhaust fan. (The comment reads, ""There was a tear in the blinds when I moved in, and now it comes apart. There was an order to fix it; it wasn't fixed; they said they would be back out but didn't come back. The exhaust fan is also still not working. Just as a note on the account."" I've included this statement to show that no one replaced the initial request when I moved into the apartment. On 12/13/2018, the shower faucet was still leaking, causing the water bill to go up and water stains and calcium build up in the shower. On 9/15/2019, I placed a work order for the A/C not working. Due to maintenance not responding to the work order and it being hot outside (High was 86 degrees and the low was 67 degrees), I had to place another ticket (9/17/2019 - the temperature was High 88 degrees and the low was 66 degrees) to have someone to come out to look at the unit. On 1/18/2020, I emailed the property manager, Cindi, to advise an incident on-site by a maintenance staff member. A member of their team placed a cone on the hood of my car, threatened to ticket the vehicle, and took paint remover to my vehicle. He was a new staff member; I advised him that I assisted on-site as their courtesy officer (state law enforcement agent). After filing a police report and a report with the front office, I was subsequently advised that my services as their courtesy officer were no longer needed. The member that damaged my car laughed at me and said I couldn't prove it was him and he still had his job. I requested a copy of the incident report but was told that executive leadership said I wasn't allowed a copy of the report. On February 26, 2020, I emailed the Property Manager (Cindi Maida) about the refrigerator not getting cold. Cindi planned to have the refrigerator looked at on 3/2. On 3/2/2020, Maintenance Supervisor Anthony Rhodes and his tech and the carpet cleaners returned to the apartment to view the refrigerator and clean the carpet. The carpet cleaners advised that the black lines in the carpet were a direct result of the a/c unit and ductwork being bad and not properly working. (I will note that no one had come to change the air filters in the three years living on site until 12/11/2019.) This prompted maintenance to remove the air intake panel. Please see the picture below of what we discovered. I have a video where you can hear maintenance talking and the machines running from the carpet cleaners. I was disgusted at what we found. Maintenance said, ""Oh, that's nothing to worry about. That is normal; it only removes the stale air from the apartment, and almost all units will look like that."" The carpet cleaners looked at me and said, no ma'am, that is not normal, and that is probably why you have black lines in the carpet under the doors. The air filter was full of a black substance. If I can add, at this time, the filter had been replaced on 12/11. What was found on this date had already been seen by maintenance when the filter was replaced on 12/11/2020 but was not addressed. It was merely covered up in hopes that I didn't notice. On 12/10/2020 at 11:41 am, Property Management sent an email advising they would be out to replace the air filters. On March 29, 2020, another refrigerator was taken from another unit and brought over to replace the unit in my kitchen. Once the unit was unplugged and removed, I noticed the hazardous material on the hose. I requested the Supervisor look at it, and he (Anthony) stated it was nothing to worry about, and we would be okay. I noted that it looked like mold and I was concerned. He said the black material wasn't mold. (I don't believe anyone can make this statement if they didn't run a test on the hazardous material). Anthony plugged the refrigerator up and left the apartment. I have a video of the black substance on the hose. On TUESDAY, 6/9/2020, The A/C unit went out again. The work order was not completed until 6/12/2020. During this time, we waited for almost four days without A/C. The temperature outside during this time was: 6/9/2020 - high 90 degrees/ low 73 degrees 6/10/2020 - high 92 degrees/ low 76 degrees 6/11/2020 - high 88 degrees/ low 71 degrees 6/12/2020 - high 85 degrees/ low 68 degrees On 8/10/2020, I placed a work order for what appeared to be black mold growing under the sink. I advised that I noticed water coming from the cabinet. The sink sprayer was leaking. Maintenance came out, changed the sprayer, and used one of my Clorox wipes to wipe the black mold substance (hazardous growth material) away and said we would be alright and it wasn't mold. Again, not at his discretion to say. He never notified anyone that the substance was growing, nor did anyone follow up to see if the growth was back. Starting in the earlier part of the year, I will advise that my headaches and hair loss were becoming increasingly severe. My son and I were experiencing difficulty breathing, hair loss, skin rashes, and allergy-like symptoms. Because of COVID and the mandates to stay home, we didn't see a doctor about what we thought could be allergies. Due to us working and attending school from home during this period, we have been in the house more than ever. Our headaches and breathing were getting very bad, and I felt no longer were allergies issues. We started taking medicine in the early part of the year. On 11/2/2020, the black substance was back on the sink and under the sink. At this moment, I started inspecting the apartment because of our symptoms and noticing that the substance was back. I took the panel off the air intake and noticed the filter was black, and a black substance was growing from around the panel and on the front of the intake. I saw a mold-like substance growing on the windows, under the sink, and on the faucet. I placed another ticket. I advised Anthony that I was contacting a mold specialist to conduct tests. On 11/3/2020, testing of the apartment by a mold specialist was conducted. On Sunday, 11/8/2020, a 20-page report, was returned to me by the company that performed the testing. In the report, it was confirmed that hazardous microbial exists in the apartment. I can't speak on behalf of the other residents. From what residents told me during my interactions as a courtesy officer and what has been written on numerous review sites, I am not the only resident to experience problems at this location. **Because I want everyone to know the outcome of what is going on, I will be updating all review sites after giving the corporate office a chance to remedy the issues and see that our health and safety are a priority.

In fairness, I am giving Corporate a chance to make things right; however, that doesn&apos;t negate the fact that the staff they have hired to work this property now and in the past is negligent. I&apos;m dealing with a confirmed case of mold, and no one has offered to see that we are safe in our living situation. The President of RECM Properties, Michele Liakos, called and stated they must see what is causing the mold issues but NEVER said that our health was a priority and concern. Never offered to relocate us while they investigate the problems. Never offered anything that would remove us from the area of the hazard. She wanted to send the same crew out to see the mold and issues more than three times now. The last time they came out, I requested they leave since I hired a mold specialist to test the apartment. You should NOT have to point out a hazardous looking substance more than three times before someone thinks, &quot;OH MAYBE WE SHOULD TEST THIS&quot; - That would be common sense. It would help if you did NOT have to pay to have someone check the apartment for someone to take you seriously. He took one of my Clorox wipes, wiped it away, and said he fixed the issue. I ask that sometimes people have empathy and do unto others as they want to be done to them. While I understand you may be upset that you have to keep coming out to the same apartment, if items are broken, fix it before leaving so you don&apos;t have to keep coming out. Lord only knows I don&apos;t want people running in and out of my apartment during the COVID. I don&apos;t like submitting work requests just as much as they don&apos;t like coming out. I&apos;ve lived on-site for over three years now and have watched more than fifteen property managers & assistant property managers come and go. I can not even begin to count the number of maintenance personnel that has come through the property. Staffing and communication are HORRIBLE. When you see the staff running around fixing and repairing items and being nice, they have received word that Corporate is coming to the site to visit. Someone from another site location will call and give a heads up that Corporate is in the area. Also, the staff begs the residents to write excellent reviews. They have called around and requested us to write good reviews to get their ratings up. So when you see that influx of good ratings in the year 2020, know they&apos;ve asked people to do that b/c Corporate reads your reviews, and they will get called out on it. I&apos;ve worked in the office and experienced them getting the calls about the reviews. So with that being said, I will tell you about my experience. I feel it is essential to take the time to write REAL reviews when you get bad customer service and excellent customer service. I moved into the apartment in 2017. According to the lease under section 12, I conducted a walk-through of the apartment and noticed several things, which I reported to the main office. . The exhaust fan was not working in the bathroom (3 years later, it still hasn&apos;t been fixed. In fact, maintenance laughed and said you don&apos;t even have a fan in there. The whole fan was removed.) . The apartment was dirty and full of bugs and empty drink bottles and trash. . The cabinets had spots that showed heavy wear and were covered with paint that was close in color but not matching. (see picture below) . The sink was used to store paint/paint buckets and other items used by maintenance. There was white paint residue spilled all in the sink and on the countertops. The sink was also separating from the counter. (picture below) . Some of the window blinds were torn I immediately contacted the property manager to advise of all the issues in the apartment. I ultimately had to pay out of pocket to have the apartment cleaned before unpacking. Maintenance came over and tried to clean the paint residue but was unable and advised the sink would not be replaced. They also advised the cabinets would not be replaced, and they would come back to replace the blinds and the exhaust fan. Maintenance never came out to replace or fix any of the requested items. I asked them to fix the fan as it was imperative that the bathroom have adequate ventilation. Maintenance never replaced the fan. On 10/24/2018, I placed a work order and addressed the exhaust fan again. (See below taken from the maintenance request log on my portal). The comment reads, &quot;The exhaust fan in the bathroom still has not been fixed, which is allowing moisture build up in the bathroom.&quot; A work order was placed: 10/24/2018 Plumbing Faucet in the bathroom shower is leaking and causing a daily build-up of hard water and staining on the shower curtain. There is also slow drainage causing the water to back up in the shower. The bathroom&apos;s exhaust fan still has not been fixed, allowing moisture to build up in the bathroom. On 11/30/2018, I placed a work order to have the blinds replaced, as there was a new maintenance crew on site. (Also addressed in the request; the exhaust fan) They came out and replaced the blinds immediately and stated they would have to have someone else look at the exhaust fan. (The comment reads, &quot;There was a tear in the blinds when I moved in, and now it comes apart. There was an order to fix it; it wasn&apos;t fixed; they said they would be back out but didn&apos;t come back. The exhaust fan is also still not working. Just as a note on the account.&quot; I&apos;ve included this statement to show that no one replaced the initial request when I moved into the apartment. On 12/13/2018, the shower faucet was still leaking, causing the water bill to go up and water stains and calcium build up in the shower. On 9/15/2019, I placed a work order for the A/C not working. Due to maintenance not responding to the work order and it being hot outside (High was 86 degrees and the low was 67 degrees), I had to place another ticket (9/17/2019 - the temperature was High 88 degrees and the low was 66 degrees) to have someone to come out to look at the unit.

According to the lease under section 12, I conducted a walk-through of the apartment and noticed several things, which I reported to the main office. . The exhaust fan was not working in the bathroom (3 years later, it still hasn&apos;t been fixed. In fact, maintenance laughed and said you don&apos;t even have a fan in there. The whole fan was removed.) . The apartment was dirty and full of bugs and empty drink bottles and trash. . The cabinets had spots that showed heavy wear and were covered with paint that was close in color but not matching. (see picture below) . The sink was used to store paint/paint buckets and other items used by maintenance. There was white paint residue spilled all in the sink and on the countertops. The sink was also separating from the counter. (picture below) . Some of the window blinds were torn I immediately contacted the property manager to advise of all the issues in the apartment. I ultimately had to pay out of pocket to have the apartment cleaned before unpacking. Maintenance came over and tried to clean the paint residue but was unable and advised the sink would not be replaced. They also advised the cabinets would not be replaced, and they would come back to replace the blinds and the exhaust fan. Maintenance never came out to replace or fix any of the requested items. I asked them to fix the fan as it was imperative that the bathroom have adequate ventilation. Maintenance never replaced the fan. On 10/24/2018, I placed a work order and addressed the exhaust fan again. (See below taken from the maintenance request log on my portal). The comment reads, &quot;The exhaust fan in the bathroom still has not been fixed, which is allowing moisture build up in the bathroom.&quot; A work order was placed: 10/24/2018 Plumbing Faucet in the bathroom shower is leaking and causing a daily build-up of hard water and staining on the shower curtain. There is also slow drainage causing the water to back up in the shower. The bathroom&apos;s exhaust fan still has not been fixed, allowing moisture to build up in the bathroom. On 11/30/2018, I placed a work order to have the blinds replaced, as there was a new maintenance crew on site. (Also addressed in the request; the exhaust fan) They came out and replaced the blinds immediately and stated they would have to have someone else look at the exhaust fan. (The comment reads, &quot;There was a tear in the blinds when I moved in, and now it comes apart. There was an order to fix it; it wasn&apos;t fixed; they said they would be back out but didn&apos;t come back. The exhaust fan is also still not working. Just as a note on the account.&quot; I&apos;ve included this statement to show that no one replaced the initial request when I moved into the apartment. On 12/13/2018, the shower faucet was still leaking, causing the water bill to go up and water stains and calcium build up in the shower. On 9/15/2019, I placed a work order for the A/C not working. Due to maintenance not responding to the work order and it being hot outside (High was 86 degrees and the low was 67 degrees), I had to place another ticket (9/17/2019 - the temperature was High 88 degrees and the low was 66 degrees) to have someone to come out to look at the unit. On 1/18/2020, I emailed the property manager, Cindi, to advise an incident on-site by a maintenance staff member. A member of their team placed a cone on the hood of my car, threatened to ticket the vehicle, and took paint remover to my vehicle. He was a new staff member; I advised him that I assisted on-site as their courtesy officer (state law enforcement agent). After filing a police report and a report with the front office, I was subsequently advised that my services as their courtesy officer were no longer needed. The member that damaged my car laughed at me and said I couldn&apos;t prove it was him and he still had his job. I requested a copy of the incident report but was told that executive leadership said I wasn&apos;t allowed a copy of the report. On February 26, 2020, I emailed the Property Manager (Cindi Maida) about the refrigerator not getting cold. Cindi planned to have the refrigerator looked at on 3/2. On 3/2/2020, Maintenance Supervisor Anthony Rhodes and his tech and the carpet cleaners returned to the apartment to view the refrigerator and clean the carpet. The carpet cleaners advised that the black lines in the carpet were a direct result of the a/c unit and ductwork being bad and not properly working. (I will note that no one had come to change the air filters in the three years living on site until 12/11/2019.) This prompted maintenance to remove the air intake panel. Please see the picture below of what we discovered. I have a video where you can hear maintenance talking and the machines running from the carpet cleaners. I was disgusted at what we found. Maintenance said, &quot;Oh, that&apos;s nothing to worry about. That is normal; it only removes the stale air from the apartment, and almost all units will look like that.&quot; The carpet cleaners looked at me and said, no ma&apos;am, that is not normal, and that is probably why you have black lines in the carpet under the doors. The air filter was full of a black substance. If I can add, at this time, the filter had been replaced on 12/11. What was found on this date had already been seen by maintenance when the filter was replaced on 12/11/2020 but was not addressed. It was merely covered up in hopes that I didn&apos;t notice. On 12/10/2020 at 11:41 am, Property Management sent an email advising they would be out to replace the air filters. On March 29, 2020, another refrigerator was taken from another unit and brought over to replace the unit in my kitchen. Once the unit was unplugged and removed, I noticed the hazardous material on the hose. I requested the Supervisor look at it, and he (Anthony) stated it was nothing to worry about, and we would be okay. I noted that it looked like mold and I was concerned. He said the black material wasn&apos;t mold. (I don&apos;t believe anyone can make this statement if they didn&apos;t run a test on the hazardous material). Anthony plugged the refrigerator up and left the apartment. I have a video of the black substance on the hose. On TUESDAY, 6/9/2020, The A/C unit went out again. The work order was not completed until 6/12/2020. During this time, we waited for almost four days without A/C. The temperature outside during this time was: 6/9/2020 - high 90 degrees/ low 73 degrees 6/10/2020 - high 92 degrees/ low 76 degrees 6/11/2020 - high 88 degrees/ low 71 degrees 6/12/2020 - high 85 degrees/ low 68 degrees On 8/10/2020, I placed a work order for what appeared to be black mold growing under the sink. I advised that I noticed water coming from the cabinet. The sink sprayer was leaking. Maintenance came out, changed the sprayer, and used one of my Clorox wipes to wipe the black mold substance (hazardous growth material) away and said we would be alright and it wasn&apos;t mold. Again, not at his discretion to say. He never notified anyone that the substance was growing, nor did anyone follow up to see if the growth was back. Starting in the earlier part of the year, I will advise that my headaches and hair loss were becoming increasingly severe. My son and I were experiencing difficulty breathing, hair loss, skin rashes, and allergy-like symptoms. Because of COVID and the mandates to stay home, we didn&apos;t see a doctor about what we thought could be allergies. Due to us working and attending school from home during this period, we have been in the house more than ever. Our headaches and breathing were getting very bad, and I felt no longer were allergies issues. We started taking medicine in the early part of the year. On 11/2/2020, the black substance was back on the sink and under the sink. At this moment, I started inspecting the apartment because of our symptoms and noticing that the substance was back. I took the panel off the air intake and noticed the filter was black, and a black substance was growing from around the panel and on the front of the intake. I saw a mold-like substance growing on the windows, under the sink, and on the faucet. I placed another ticket. I advised Anthony that I was contacting a mold specialist to conduct tests. On 11/3/2020, testing of the apartment by a mold specialist was conducted. On Sunday, 11/8/2020, a 20-page report, was returned to me by the company that performed the testing. In the report, it was confirmed that hazardous microbial exists in the apartment. I can&apos;t speak on behalf of the other residents. From what residents told me during my interactions as a courtesy officer and what has been written on numerous review sites, I am not the only resident to experience problems at this location. **Because I want everyone to know the outcome of what is going on, I will be updating all review sites after giving the corporate office a chance to remedy the issues and see that our health and safety are a priority. I wish not for anyone to go through the pain and suffering we have had to endure during these past three years.

112624061,"When i first moved in i was very excited and impressed at how great their customer service was. I was living in a two bed two bath. Things started falling apart once we moved in. The handle off the fridge, the blinds kept falling off, and our washer kept flooding. The bathroom wasn't clean from the start but you know i just decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. I had a year lease there and during my year lease i got diagnosed with Lyme Disease and i notified the manager and she told her staff. The main thing with that is i cannot be around chemicals mold etc. in July 2019 my roommate and i noticed mold growing in the bathtub so we called management and they came up and checked it out they looked at it for 2 seconds and said ""nope that's not mold"" and caulked over it. It being my first apartment I thought I could trust them as I am just that kind of person. Then doing more research with my Lyme and mold, mold can be detrimental with Lyme patients but then came to find out mold is not good for anyone and I started reading mold toxicity symptoms and they matched up to mine. So i decided to take it into my own hands and hired a professional. I had an air quality test done in three parts of my home and swabs as well. A couple day's later high levels of mold and specifically penicillin, aspergillus, cladosporium came back. I also got a second opinion and he agreed about all the mold and he said if you were to knock these walls down there would be mold everywhere. My Lyme doctor right away wrote me a letter saying i could not live there even a normal healthy person could not live there because mold isn't safe. The mold company suggested I get out as soon as possible. Right away I turned in the report to management and they asked why I didn't have them hire someone even though they denied it was mold from the beginning. They have a closet full of the hvac system that is locked which is not normal for most apartments and come to find out there was water stains all over in there and two of the professional mold guys confirmed it was mold. The only reason they broke the lease was because of my doctors note but the manager was very confrontational regarding the issue. I assumed after we moved out there would be remediation but Came to find out right after we moved out they were showing the apartment. Since i moved out i have stopped running into the walls, inflammation in my face and body has gone down, my cough is gone, and my mental capacity is better than it was. Mold is not safe for anyone and the fact that Broadmoor is hiding it and moving more people in is a problem and I am sure it is happening over and over. Down below are pictures of the mold and and my results for the apartment along with symptoms regarding mold toxicity. I feel so bad whoever moved into that apartment.","When i first moved in i was very excited and impressed at how great their customer service was. I was living in a two bed two bath. Things started falling apart once we moved in. The handle off the fridge, the blinds kept falling off, and our washer kept flooding. The bathroom wasn&apos;t clean from the start but you know i just decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. I had a year lease there and during my year lease i got diagnosed with Lyme Disease and i notified the manager and she told her staff. The main thing with that is i cannot be around chemicals mold etc. in July 2019 my roommate and i noticed mold growing in the bathtub so we called management and they came up and checked it out they looked at it for 2 seconds and said &quot;nope that&apos;s not mold&quot; and caulked over it. It being my first apartment I thought I could trust them as I am just that kind of person. Then doing more research with my Lyme and mold, mold can be detrimental with Lyme patients but then came to find out mold is not good for anyone and I started reading mold toxicity symptoms and they matched up to mine. So i decided to take it into my own hands and hired a professional. I had an air quality test done in three parts of my home and swabs as well. A couple day&apos;s later high levels of mold and specifically penicillin, aspergillus, cladosporium came back. I also got a second opinion and he agreed about all the mold and he said if you were to knock these walls down there would be mold everywhere. My Lyme doctor right away wrote me a letter saying i could not live there even a normal healthy person could not live there because mold isn&apos;t safe. The mold company suggested I get out as soon as possible. Right away I turned in the report to management and they asked why I didn&apos;t have them hire someone even though they denied it was mold from the beginning. They have a closet full of the hvac system that is locked which is not normal for most apartments and come to find out there was water stains all over in there and two of the professional mold guys confirmed it was mold. The only reason they broke the lease was because of my doctors note but the manager was very confrontational regarding the issue. I assumed after we moved out there would be remediation but Came to find out right after we moved out they were showing the apartment. Since i moved out i have stopped running into the walls, inflammation in my face and body has gone down, my cough is gone, and my mental capacity is better than it was.

There is a family of 5 raccoons that have made their home at this complex, and they will come onto your porch, no matter what floor you are on, and eat all your plants and destroy patio decor in the process. I've had a consistent bug problem since I moved in here, which was 6 months. The walls are also paper-thin, you can hear everything. This complex also chooses not to make appointments before maintenance comes to your apartment. Multiple times I have put in work orders and maintenance or pest control and will just show up unannounced. They don't tell you a time frame, nor days of the week to expect them. It was annoying when they would show up unannounced, but I dealt with it. It actually became a problem when a maintenance guy showed up one time when I was sleeping. He unlocked the door, opened it slightly, and yelled out to me. I woke up from the yell, and I still didn't know he was at the door. He put a hand into the door frame and yelled again, and that's when I looked over and realized someone was at my door and had opened my door when it was locked and was sticking their hand inside. I was scared because I'm a single girl living on m own: I had just woken up, I wasn't dressed and from my perspective, it looked like a stranger was coming into my apartment. He yelled that it was maintenance again and I registered what was going on and I immediately screamed at him to NOT come in. He didn't close the door but waited. Come to find out that this apartment complex doesn't think it's necessary to schedule appointments prior to maintenance showing up, when you submit a work order request. They also don't give you any time frame whatsoever on when maintenance will show up and said that due to COVID and how backed up they were, it would be impossible to give anyone a heads up. I would rather wait to have my apartment worked on, having even a general time frame when maintenance will show up, then have to go through that unnecessary and unprofessional situation. I even have it down in my information for the apartment portal that if maintenance needs to come, they should call me first, or at least let me know which days to expect them because first, I would put my cat away so he doesn't try to run out the door, and second, so I can avoid instances like this. I called the leasing office to explain what had happened and the girl at the leasing office (Alyssa) told me they have every right to show up when they want and they don't have to give us any warning. I told her that even though it was 11AM, I had been asleep and I was scared that someone was breaking into my home because I didn't know what was going on and that I even have it down in my information that they need to at least give me a heads up. She implied that I was in the wrong because I was asleep at 11AM and I was invalid for feeling the way I did. I work night shifts twice a month...not that I owe the complex an explanation of why I wasn't wide awake and waiting for maintenance at 11AM, but this is my apartment, I live here and I should be able to feel safe in my apartment.

The model apartment is strictly for the 4bed 2bath layout. Those units are the only renovated apartments since the new management. So if you're interested in the 3bed 3bath, you're more than likely getting an old, dirty apartment. Be sure to ask if your apartment you're moving to has been renovated. Since these rooms are individually leased, if all but one roommate moves out, the apartment can not be renovated since there is still someone living in the apartment. 

The building is old and infested with American roaches. Not the tiny roaches but giant roaches. I keep my room CLEAN. My roommate is a clean freak and spends hours cleaning the kitchen and common area but that did not help. They charge for pest control monthly but they will only come out when you call. 

Their roommate matching is a joke. I don't think they take the time to ensure that you will be compatabile with your future roommates. 

The staffs are nice but they are not helpful. I spent two months, almost daily, trying to get someone to help get my internet working. They finally blamed it on Time Warner and said they were restricted to their schedule. 

I'm just happy that my lease is ending next month and I can finally move out of this shit hole.","BEWARE: The Connection, formally known as the Heights

Also, when we leased the apartment, we were told that utilities were included. I later learned that each resident gets a $30 utility allowance.

I called the office to inquire about the overage fee and I was told that ""most students"" have utility overages.

My concern is that Blanton Common will not prove whether the utility overages are legitimate or if they are randomly applying overage fees to gouge poor college students. And, in order to make a one time payment online, it cost $19.95--ridiculous.

975282,"I moved to northwood apartments the summer after graduating highschool years ago. I stayed for one year, and I wish I had known then what I know now about apartments. I tend to ramble, so let me divide this up

location:
you can't ask for a better location. It's within walking distance to CSU (well
if Columbus had sidewalks it would be) and it's on armour road so it's very close to airport and Manchester expressway. You can be anywhere in Columbus in minutes

parking was never an issue
security was never an issue, I never had anything stolen or vandalized and the grounds always looked well kept

it was very pet friendly. Though once I was in the emergency room all day, so my puppy was locked in her cage and maintenence was repairing something in the apartment next door and banging around a lot. I was called later that day and told my puppy wouldn't work out because it kept crying. I explained the situation and was excused for that one time, and my dog was never an issue again. I actually appreciate this because it means they take a decisive and quick move on behalf of their residents. No one wants to hear a dog cry for hours on end.

The apartment:

the floorplan was spacious for a (then) less than $500 one bedroom. Nothing special, but not a cramped as I would have expected. The living room was standard, the kitchen was one of those hallway kitchens, but it did has a dining area next to it, then the bedroom was decent size and the bathroom was very large, it has the washer/dryer hook
ups. 

Bugs: 

I had knats, they drove me crazy. I couldn't leave water out for the pets, had to plug all the sinks, and generally just had to be careful. Pouring bleach down the drain daily didn't deter them. I went to school full
time and worked full time (the puppy lived at work mostly, pet shop/daycare boarding place/ grooming place) i
didn't even eat at home, so no mess there. I don't remember their pest control
policy, but knats were all I ever saw, no roaches or ants so they had to be spraying something.

Noise: 

Noise was a major problem. I lived on the top story in the back, so I never heard from my neighbors beside me and didn't have noise below, but we had neighbors in the building who would argue a lot. That wasn't so bad, what's apparently unlivable is living on the bottom floor. 
I got new neighbors below me 6 months into my lease. According to them
my walking around (I'm barely 5 foot and was maybe 120 pounds then) caused their whole house to shake. The television was easier to hear in their apartment than mine, and my spoken conversations were shouting matches to their ears. One of them
worked days, one worked nights, so someone was always sleeping. Every step I took resulted in them calling the manager to complain that I was maliciously stomping around. Frankly if I want to do arobics at 2:00 in the afternoon I should be able to, but Im
more considerate than that, and I was home from
9 at night to 6 in the morning, I would walk in, get called and yelled at, sit down and watch tv, have the cops called on me, (the police could not hear the television from my front door which shared a wall with the tv, I was so afraid to watch it audibly that I had to keep closed caption on to understand the dialougue)  go to bed,
wake up, get ready, have the neighbors pounding on their ceiling until
I left, and get a call from the manager later that day inresponse to a noise complaint. That is why I didn't renew my lease. But it's unlikely anyone else will get neighbors that paranoid and crazy.

Management:
i never had a maintnence complaint, and had no reason to speak with the manager or landlord until I had live there six months and got the crazy neighbors. What i didn't know then (I sort of veiwed the manager as a principal) is how unprofessionally things were handled. Most apartments send letters if there is a problem. I would get called on my cell phone, at work, and my mother (co-signer for lease) would also get a call, much to her annoyance. Mostly the problem was the neighbors claiming I was disturbing the peace, sometimes while I wasn't even home. I really feel the fact that they were older than me gained them more respect. I kept telling the manager I wasn't making noise, my next door neighbor backed me up, but I was the college kid, so the noise complaints must be true. Nevermind that I was never home, and even if the speakers for the tv were hooked into their apartment magically I was generally asleep by 11, I was treated like I was in the wrong. After months of this, I had one issue with my rent check, it bounced because my paycheck failed to direct deposit. I got a huge apology from my employer, who later called and told the landlord, but not before I got 7 missed calls of my cell, each with a message talking about the felony of writing a bad check, many calls at work, and calls to my mother demanding rent. She was worried and promptly paid it, but needless to say, I was angry. I wrote the landlord a letter (immature of my part I know, but I was young and stupid) telling him not to call
me again, particularaly not at work, and for goodness sakes leave my mother out of it. Leave a letter at the door, but the constant calling has to stop. I said a few other things to, mostly about how i wouldn't tell everyone I knew not to
move there because I was so sick of it, and that I would be moving out at the end of my lease in 60 days. 
The landlord reacted just as immaturely, telling me he had done me a favor before by not adding a late fee or a bounce fee to rent (true, but the rent issue was a bank error, well an admitted employer error) but he no longer felt the need to be nice and would add $250 of fees that needed to be paid asap. That's about half a months rent.  Oh and he sent a copy
of the letter I sent him to my mom. 

Now, this was years ago, and i certainly could have handled things better. For 6 months I had no issues at the complex at all, I would still reccomend this as a place to live because you really can't beat the price. I wasn't aware of how good of a deal it was then, but I am
now. I feel I was treated differently because of my age, but I'm
sure I was acting immaturely myself (not to the ppoint of intentionally stomping on the floor as accused but still. I'm sure I could have been more gracious) I don't think the craziness of my
situation is likely to repeat itself for anyone else.
I've never ever ever had a problem like that at any of the other complexes I've lived. For most people I think the apartment would be great. Just get a top floor, and don't be afraid to limit contact with the leasing office to written communication.  ","I moved to northwood apartments the summer after graduating highschool years ago.

112670135,"I never leave reviews but during my time at Riverhouse 11 I was stunned by the amount of negligence and discrimination I went through. Let's talk about how Kristen Boyer and Alexander Whittle run a clown show. I moved to Riverhouse 11 on 10/2018, couple of days after my move in I started having heat and hot water issue which continued over my entire time living there. Even with no access to basic utilities I managed to pay my monthly rent on time. When requested to be reimbursed for the inconvenience. I requested half a month worth of rent and instead I was offered rent credit worth of $200 in exchange to me signing a release form stating that Rosland is not responsible for the inconvenience, which I refused to sign however was harassed with numerous reminder to sign the form with out the decency from management to follow up on whether the issues was resolved. I was also accused by Kristin, the cause of heat system failure is due to my furniture. However, in February management requested for meter service vendor to examine my heat and while speaking to the outside vendor (mind you management rescheduled my appointment last minute on three different occasions not caring that I had to make special arrangements to be at home to give access to the technician), the individual stated that the heat issue is from a technical system error. Not to reference, I was promised that outside vendor will be accompanied by a staff; however, the individual showed up to my apartment alone. I was also denied communication with my neighbors through the building bulletin board on multiple occasions. Management rejected all my posted. I have reached out to management with my assessment of the many issues I've sustained and went unanswered; included but not limited to the following, multiple heat issues, beside the original problem, the heat continued to turn off during the night, without warning. The 9th floor has a constant smell of smoke, as well as marijuana and the trash room constantly smelled horrible. These issues, coupled with the building's lack of security have made it apprehensive and unwilling to continue to live there. Rosland breach the contract I originally signed. Kristen originally agreed with my original email stating the following ""I did agree with your assessment that we are being negligent and are in breach of contract. I understand that you are not happy and that we have not succeeded in meeting your expectations."" However, few days later she thought that changing the word agree to ""disagree"" would change the whole language of her email stating that it was a ""typo"". Not to reference the numerous miscommunication trends by her. I decided to reached out to corporate office and that's when I spoke to Alexander Whittle during our phone conversation which she didn't try to find a solution to my constant issues she stated ""we don't have a crystal ball to tell you when things will be resolved or when outside technician expected to show up to your unit"". Living there was not bearable anymore, when I asked to end my contract due to a breach from Rosland, they wanted to penalize me, I was promised that they would list my apartment on the market ""like any others"" but that never happened, they posted my apartment on the market after more than 3 weeks from my 60 days notice. I had to do all the work and find some one to take over my lease during this pandemic. Lastly, During my hard time where I didn't have hot water and heat for numerous consecutive days, I went to the office to communicate with Kristen, however she denied to communicate with me stating ""I am busy with lease renewals at the moment"" without giving me an alternative time or date to discuss my issues. Also during my move out day, Kristen knew that it was time for me to hand in my keys; however, she decided to lock the office and instructed conseguir to inform me that she is busy and to leave my keys with them. Hence, few minutes after I left the building Kristen had the audacity to email me with a ""manual"" outstanding water bill created by her. I could go on withy experience and the amount of discrimination and lack of receiving basic necessities for the $$$ I was paying there.","I never leave reviews but during my time at Riverhouse 11 I was stunned by the amount of negligence and discrimination I went through.

112667627,"My 75-year-old uncle, retired, disabled, Veteran moved into The Crossing At The One on April 8, 2020, with a lease start date of April 7, 2020, after relocating from Florida 2 weeks ago. The apartment advertises as Cable and Satellite ready but with the recent renovations of their apartments some of the cable lines to the newly renovated apartments were cut making it impossible for Xfinity (Comcast) to set up the cable or Wi-Fi in his apartment. It took Xfinity (Comcast) 2 days to realize that the problem with the lack of cable and Wi-Fi was with the apartment complex and not them. I promptly informed the leasing agent Lorin via telephone in the presence of my uncle, at the request of my uncle, on April 8, 2020, and she informed me that she will let her manager know. On April 9, 2020, after Xfinity (Comcast) provided me with a courtesy call, I called the leasing agent Lorin to find out when will the wires to the attic be repaired so my uncle can have cable and Wi-Fi. The leasing agent informed me that she sent her manager and email. On the morning of April 10, 2020, the leasing agent Lorin informed me that the wires will be repaired on that day and I thank her for her help. To my surprise, my personal email address was forward to the Leasing Director Libby Manicone without my knowledge or permission and a few hours later I received an email from Libby, the email stated, and I quote ""Good morning XXXXX, I understand that you had requested service in the apartment for Mr. XXXXX. I wanted to pass along that going forward, we cannot entertain any requests from you personally. Mr. XXXX will have to do so as the leaseholder. If you wish to be added to the lease, Mr. XXXXX can request an add roommate and we can run the screening process for you. Thank you for your cooperation. Best Regards, Libby Manicone, Leasing Director100 Tulip Drive, Fords, NJ 08863 "" end quote. Please keep mind all I did was bring to their attention that the apartment was not cable ready on day 1 of my uncle moving into the apartment, which was April 8, 2020. Somehow something that was advertised as an amenity included in the rent that should have been available on move-in day is now a service that I requested. No one reached out to my uncle on April 8 or April 9 to confirm this request. It was not until April 10, 2020, my uncle was contacted and it was not about the apartment not being moving in ready it was about me requesting service for his apartment and them wanting to reconfirm my role and confirming whether or not if I was planning to live with him, although he made it clear in the application and the signing of the lease that he will be living alone. April 8, April 9, and April 10 went by and the cables in the attic were still not repaired. To add icing on the cake, while we were waiting for someone to make pairs to the cable in the attic above his apartment, we decided to do a very small load of laundry to kill time and then we discovered that the washing machine wasn't working on April 10, 2020. My uncle sent an email to the Leasing Director and she informed him that she will contact maintenance but, in the future, he needs to contact maintenance. Which I promptly did after my uncle brought it to my attention. My uncle is 3 days into moving into his apartment and by the end of the business day on April 10, 2020, there was no cable, no Wi-Fi, no working washing machine, and now it appeared that the heat was not working in the apartment on this particularly cold and windy day. My uncle was so upset about the entire situation and keeping in mind that the elderly are most vulnerable during the Coronavirus pandemic, I had no choice but to book a hotel room for him for the Easter weekend. Hopefully, on April 13, 2020, when he checks out of his hotel room and returns home this will all be water under the bridge, and he can feel happy about his decision to move to New Jersey and into Crossings. However, if I could do it all over again, I would have insisted that he moved into one of the newly built apartments in the surrounding areas. The location of Crossings is convenient but at the end of the day, it's an old building with a facelift regardless of what amenities promised to you. I strongly suggested to my uncle that leasing an apartment with Crossings might be a big mistake, but he fell in love with the location of the apartment complex. Who knew that Crossings would have proved me right within 72 hours of him moving into the apartment...and my uncle would be regretting his decision. I felt that Lorin Williams, the Leasing agent, did her best to accommodate the needs of my uncle. However, I felt that the unexpected email from the Leasing Director Libby could have been handled a little bit differently and it was an unnecessary communication between Libby and myself adding unnecessary stress to an already stressful situation. Libby could have easily sent my uncle an email directly without contacting me at all and address his concerns on why the apartment was not moved in ready and then Libby would have known that my uncle was present and fully aware that the Xfinity (Comcast) Technician informed me that the cable's wires to his apartment was completely cut and could only be repaired by Crossings. The apartment being cable-ready is the responsibility of Crossings and not my uncle's or even Xfinity (Comcast). A problem was brought to their attention and it's their job to fix it…period. Regardless of how Management wants to spin this situation, this was clearly unprofessionalism at its best. Crossings formerly Menlo Park Apartments and Kensington Apartments always have a way of making people of color feel like they are doing you a favor by allowing you to rent their apartments as if they are giving it to you for free. The fact that Xfinity (Comcast) reached out to me and my uncle on April 8, April 9, and April 10 after it was clear that there were not at fault for the situation, says a lot about Crossings and how much Crossings care about their new tenants, especially if this is how they treated my uncle and he has only been there for 3 days. I hate that I was right about Crossings but it's still the same old unprofessional, disrespectful, racist staff running the show, that doesn't understand that without tenants they wouldn't have a job.","My 75-year-old uncle, retired, disabled, Veteran moved into The Crossing At The One on April 8, 2020, with a lease start date of April 7, 2020, after relocating from Florida 2 weeks ago.

It is chalk for Christ's sake it washes off. But god forbid your workers have to actually do any damn work. It's horrible what they did ruining the kids fun that way it's not like they were vandalizing anything with permanent paint or anything. God you can't breathe without the apartment making a letter to you about bullshit. Also why the hell is it so hard to pay the rent here my god you either have to pay online or go to Walmart. What about the old people what the hell is that about. There are so many places with multiple ways to give rent to make it easier on the residents ooooohhhh but not here you have to jumps through hoops like your in a circle to get shit done.

I currently live in the Plantation Gardens Apartment Homes, I have lived here since 2/16 and it has been a nightmare. In the short time I lived here I have had the following problems:(I HAVE PICTURES AS PROOF)

1. The management states my apartment was upgrade, however the freezer fan was broken and had to be replaced after 2 weeks into the apartment.

2. The dishwasher still does not work correctly( this was supposed to be new).

3. The shelves on the wall in both closets will not stay on the wall.

4. RATS are everywhere around the complex.(In the walls, the attic, and the roof) Management refuses to get rid of the issues.

5. Garbage is pilled up all around the complex( sitting out side the mailbox, at the main garbage cans, in the cloth washing areas and all over the grounds)

6. Management has a not caring attitude.

7. Everyone smokes on the property.(Violation of the lease, suppose to be a smoke free community)

8. People hang out all night drinking in the parking lot and leaves beer cans in the parking lot.

9. Neighbor dogs barks ALL night, especially at 1,2 and 3 AM when my kids are sleep.

10.Rats are in my apartment walls and occasionally they come into the house and terrorizing my family by biting and chewing on everything.

11. Toilet seat are broken in the master bathroom.

12. Master bathroom door does not stay open due to the unit is not level.

13. I do not have any screen windows or a screen for my patio door. This has been on order for 5 months.

14. The ceiling is leaking in the 2nd bedroom.

15. The baloney is damaged and the concrete is chipping away.

16. The stairs are dirty and the hallways stinks.

17. The leasing agent that sold me a unit that she claims was upgraded was fired due to unfair rental practices.

18. The roof and drywall are separating.

19. The ceilings have major cracks in them.

20. The apartment has at least 20 holes in the walls that was patched very badly.

I have went to the rental office several times and the last time I spoke to Todd Keslow, he is the community Manager. This guy is clueless on the issues going on at the apartment complex that he suppose to be managing.
I was told that there are no notes on my account and he needs to look into the situation. Todd told me it can take up the 3 weeks for him to figure out what needs to be in my apartment. I have been complaining about the same issues since I moved in.

11. Toilet seat are broken in the master bathroom.

12. Master bathroom door does not stay open due to the unit is not level.

13. I do not have any screen windows or a screen for my patio door. This has been on order for 5 months.

14. The ceiling is leaking in the 2nd bedroom.

15. The baloney is damaged and the concrete is chipping away.

16. The stairs are dirty and the hallways stinks.

17. The leasing agent that sold me a unit that she claims was upgraded was fired due to unfair rental practices.

18. The roof and drywall are separating.

19. The ceilings have major cracks in them.

20. The apartment has at least 20 holes in the walls that was patched very badly.

I have went to the rental office several times and the last time I spoke to Todd Keslow, he is the community Manager. This guy is clueless on the issues going on at the apartment complex that he suppose to be managing.
I was told that there are no notes on my account and he needs to look into the situation. Todd told me it can take up the 3 weeks for him to figure out what needs to be in my apartment. I have been complaining about the same issues since I moved in. I requested to be moved into a new location and I was denied, Todd and the entire management is lazy and does not really care about the community or the residents and this is the case because they do not live in the horrible community. *****WARNING****** DO NOT MOVE IN HERE, YOU WILL REGRET IT******STAY AWAY****************************RATS AND CRIME ******************",517,0.0487455197132616,0.0,True
853530,"I cannot recommend this Apt bldg.  In fact of all the places I have lived in my life, I have never nor do I want to again experience such an unpleasant atmosphere. It is a over age 55 bldg, but many many tenants do not refect that mature or grandparent type personna. Many have the personna of Portland's many social woes.  Mental Illness, homelessness, drug or alcohol problems.    There are some that appear to be respectful types but they are so few, that the atmosphere is very depressing.   The enviromnent has strong overtones of glorifed homelessness among many residents.  It is income restricted but some pay fairly high rents and pay dearly for parking. Those that do pay higher rents it is based on thier pensions or income they have earned in thier lives.   Many pay little or nothing for rent because they have little income, and from my observation here, they have little interest in gaining income thru a part-time job.   I think it is nice that those that pay nothing have a roof over thier head, however at least make an attempt to help yourself.  It really isn't fair to those paying high rents and being made to feel they are subsidized for the privledge of paying almost $700 and higher if parking is involved.  Utilities are paid for by the tenant as they should be, but it seems many are even subsidized for that, must be nice.  Though Id rather pay my way.    The management's personality is very distant and unfeeling, and the vibe is not welcoming.  There are a number of not so true comments when one inquires about living here.  Such as the waiting list for parking, or the number of laundry rooms.  The comments given by management are false and very misleading.  The staff takes parking places for themselves, and shows no effort to help a tenant get a space, even after a year and more of living here.  There is one laundry room and I was told there were two. There is not even one comment that after a years lease the rent is month to month.    Basically there is nothing in this neighborhood for the lower let alone average income person, it is glorifed segregation amonst high income young people or Im told wealthy retirees in the high end Condos Bldgs in the area.  No I can't recommend this place, and though I can't leave this bldg at this time, it is in my plan for late 2009.  I will say in their favor at this point I have not had problems with maintenance and there is free internet in each apt.

1241566,"I've lived here twice and really enjoy the place. The first time was my first apartment ever, so I didn't really know what to compare it to. The apartments are spacious, especially for their cost, and the amenities are decent. Some units have hideous wallpaper, but not all of them. Tile floors downstairs and linoleum in the bathroom upstairs. The management has always been great with me. They've waived a late fee before, and maintenance is always prompt. They also have monthly pest control that has always been there on time. 

The first year I didn't know how good it was until I moved somewhere closer to campus. The management at the place I moved to couldn't give a crap, and took two months and five maintenance visits to get the shower to stop leaking through the ceiling and causing a huge mold spot in the living room. Maintenance at Brighton Park has always been there within 24 hours with anything that has ever gone wrong, including getting a new A/C unit one time. 

They have pretty good landscapers and there are two small ponds in the middle of the place. Sometimes people will throw trash into the ponds, which is lame, but usually they are pretty nice. 

Because of the low cost there are some ghetto people that live here, so sometimes you will get annoyed by people driving by with their subwoofers, but that is the only problem with noise I have had. Since all units are townhomes, there's nobody above/beneath you to cause any noise, and I've never had problems from anybody next to me. We have one of the condos that faces the road, and in the front bedroom there is a little bit of road noise, but usually nothing to hear unless there is honking or an ambulance.

I moved back here a second time because of how great the value and management is.

P.S. they will give you free washer/dryer with a 12 month lease.","I&#39;ve lived here twice and really enjoy the place.

There is also a homeless camping issue that the management staff will not address and it's bad in the summer with scavengers, homeless campers, persons who roam the complex at al hours of the day not to mention the cops are a constant fixture at the complex. Do yourself a favor, look around before you plant your feet at Twin Creeks, you'll be glad you did.

112627507,"Please read - When choosing an MAA managed property seriously question their maintenance handling procedure. I am a current resident with MAA and am appalled by the way they have handled habitual flooding in my unit. My home has flooded a total of 8 times as well as incurred numerous other maintenance issues as a result. The most recent of which has happened from 12.19.2019 to present. Sadly major flooding occurred during the holiday period which included Christmas eve, day and New Years' eve, day. There has been a severe lack of staff accountability and a lack of communication between each other. Which has resulted, at times no one coming out to fix an active flood. Over the holiday period, I had to stay with friends as my unit was not fit for habitation. I requested compensation from MAA to which the manager replied, ""that's why you have Renters Insurance, file a claim"" and then to be moved into a different unit as there is a habitual problem. To which MAA replied 'you can, however, you would need to pay Transfer Fees, sign a new lease with new terms, conditions and rent at a higher rate than I am currently paying.' After the 7th time the flooding occurred, enough was enough and I requested that the lease be terminated to which the response was 'you can but would need to give 60 days notice and pay a fee of 2.5x my monthly rent.' Naturally, as this was the holidays I had little money free to do so, and in my opinion, not an adequate method in which to provide help after the 7th incident. I had reached out to the VP and area manager in an attempt to resolve the issue to which I received no direct communication from them. It seems that ultimately what MAA cares about it its bottom line and less about their clients or the conditions they live in. I am myself in the real estate industry and shocked by the way they have handled this. Apartment locators beware, do not refer to your clients to MAA unless you do not want to receive complaints and renters please use extreme caution should you choose to live at a property managed by this company. They are in no way on your side.","Please read - When choosing an MAA managed property seriously question their maintenance handling procedure.

With the exception of one leasing agent the entire office staff is rude rude rude, particularly a young man named James. I have lived here for several years and have not met a single person that has anything nice to say about him. I can't understand why he still works here; it seems like nobody has had a good experience with him. Rumor has it that he's having an affair with Chris, the person that runs the place, who is also a jerk. The ""rapid response"" maintenance that they brag about seems to be a bunch of cut-rate well meaning guys who mostly don't have a clue what they are doing and fix everything half-a**ed. Usually by the third or fourth time you call them out to fix something if finally gets patched up in an acceptable manner. The buildings are very old, they keep the outside looking nice for the most part but the inside isn't so great. When you move in they don't put new carpet in unless the previous people absolutely destroyed it ( I have never moved into a place that doesn't provide new carpet for each new tenant ) and they have some guys in a beat up old van that looks like it doubles as a mobile meth lab come out and shampoo it before you move in. Most of the buildings entryways have an unpleasant odor from the hot water heaters flooding and soaking the carpets. The security guards are all very nice with the exception of this Irish guy who seems to think he's a CIA agent. Like I said its decent for this area but considering your other choices around here are housing projects thats really not saying much. For what they charge I would say spend the extra couple hundred dollars and move to a nice new place in Trinity. When I moved in it was mostly older people that lived here and it was quiet but now its a lot of young kids with loud cars blasting loud music. Oh and lots of rednecks working on their trucks in the middle of the parking lot. They say they have a strict screening process but judging by the downhill quality of the residents moving in over time and the number of vacant apartments they currently have I would say they are getting a little lax with that process. I have a couple months left here and definitely will not be renewing.","Nicest place to live in this part of New Port Richey but thats not saying much.

I have lived here for several years and have not met a single person that has anything nice to say about him. I can't understand why he still works here; it seems like nobody has had a good experience with him. Rumor has it that he's having an affair with Chris, the person that runs the place, who is also a jerk. The ""rapid response"" maintenance that they brag about seems to be a bunch of cut-rate well meaning guys who mostly don't have a clue what they are doing and fix everything half-a**ed. Usually by the third or fourth time you call them out to fix something if finally gets patched up in an acceptable manner. The buildings are very old, they keep the outside looking nice for the most part but the inside isn't so great. When you move in they don't put new carpet in unless the previous people absolutely destroyed it ( I have never moved into a place that doesn't provide new carpet for each new tenant ) and they have some guys in a beat up old van that looks like it doubles as a mobile meth lab come out and shampoo it before you move in. Most of the buildings entryways have an unpleasant odor from the hot water heaters flooding and soaking the carpets. The security guards are all very nice with the exception of this Irish guy who seems to think he's a CIA agent. Like I said its decent for this area but considering your other choices around here are housing projects thats really not saying much. For what they charge I would say spend the extra couple hundred dollars and move to a nice new place in Trinity. When I moved in it was mostly older people that lived here and it was quiet but now its a lot of young kids with loud cars blasting loud music. Oh and lots of rednecks working on their trucks in the middle of the parking lot. They say they have a strict screening process but judging by the downhill quality of the residents moving in over time and the number of vacant apartments they currently have I would say they are getting a little lax with that process. I have a couple months left here and definitely will not be renewing.","Nicest place to live in this part of New Port Richey but thats not saying much.

112586260,"First, I actually did live here for over a year. Second, it was the worse living experience of my life. Third, much of the problems have to do with poor construction. Finally, the management has a lot to be desired. The complex, on its face, is a beautiful property. Everything is open & clean looking. However, it is poorly constructed with serious sound proofing issues. Hardwood flooring on all levels w/no insulation. Outlets with electrical shorts. Thin walls. Not enough dumpsters. The gym is spectacular & the club room beautiful. But only one small pool for the entire property. The first year I lived there during a big rain, the property, including the pool flooded. The storage units & garages were full of water, causing shorts in the garage doors. The concrete sidewalks started cracking within months of completion. When I left Ascend in September 2019, there were still construction workers & trucks. Now, management...... The pros is that there are 4 people on staff in the office so you can usually find someone at their desk 7 days a week. However, my experience with the managers Jason Preston & Kaytee Kelly was disastrous. I had lived at another nearby property that Jason managed for 5 of the 8 years I lived there. Several tenants & I ended up contacting the owners about Jason. The Regional Director flew in the next day to meet with us. Jason was gone in less than 30 days & an outstanding new manager was brought it. Last October, Jason & Kelly made up a lie to get an Immediate Eviction action against me, merely because I helped another resident when they tried to evict her based on ""quiet enjoyment"". In a way, we all AGREED to a ""lack of quiet enjoyment"" when we moved on to a new complex that was only half built. The action was swiftly Dismissed after I contacted Jason & Kaytee's supervisors at Pinnacle Property Management, informing them that I had substantive proof that I had not threatened anyone nor had I ever been arrested in my life. Jason is unable to make the simplest management decision w/o waiting for the owners approval. Including granting a me an UNASSIGNED parking space closer to my apartment. I had to create a schematic with measurements & remind him of the ""reasonable accommodation"" mandates under the American Disabilities Act. He wanted me to fill out ""legal papers"" & get ""approval from (Ascend's) lawyers"". I eventually called Pinnacle to get the space. I am not the only person who had these problems with management. Neither the building quality or management support the high rents.","First, I actually did live here for over a year. Second, it was the worse living experience of my life.

112521417,"If I could give zero stars I would. We were residents for over 5.5 years (2013-2019). The prior management when it was Bell Historic was outstanding. However, the past 2.5 years have been really bad. We moved a number of times within the property. Our most recent experience the office had messed up the move in date as such the apartment was not ready in time. The cabinet doors were stained against the grain which they ultimately agreed to replace them which took 6 months. The flooring was buckled in some places and divots in many places. The cleaning people did a horrible job, the previous residents used candles and there was black soot everywhere including the inside of the kitchen cabinets. They changed landscapers in the last year or so and I had never seen the grass so incredibly weedy everywhere. But the most frustrating was when they went to a shared water model for the residents, even though there were individual meters and I had been paying my bills based on my personal usage for the previous 4 years. This shared water included the landscape irrigation, any pool fills, etc. They based it off of the sq foot, number of occupants, and percentage of occupancy of the property. Not only did they violate the lease by changing this for each resident prior to lease renewals but they didn't monitor it. Since I had all my previous bills I started to monitor the new water bills to see how much of an increase I would see. Two months into the new system I noticed an 85% increase in my bill. I brought to the attention of management immediately. Which they said they would look into and then said it was due to the summer months. The next month it was 100% increase. I again brought it to their attention and they blew me off. I continued to press and later found out on my own that there were two leaks on the property. After months of paying more than 100% increase they finally got it fixed. During this time they ignored other residents inquiries on the topic. I raised the issue to Regional Management which got the attention for a bit but then they stopped responding as well. I could go on forever at the incompetents of management at this facility specifically Brenda Lee. Their one saving grace was Lee in Maintenance. He was the only redeeming quality they had. Well Lee left in May of 2019 at the same time we terminated our lease. This property was built in 2013 and has not been well maintained and the apartments are starting to show it. We had two water leaks from the roof in two different apartments along with many other issues associated with a lack of investment back in the property. They used to high pressure clean the outdoor hallways monthly which turned to quarterly which now doesn't exist. The outdoor grills rarely worked. They had a company come and paint all the exterior of the property like the railings, etc. The company never primed the surfaces and all the paint was peeling in less than a year. They have a great location but after a while it will be hard to overlook the issues especially when you are paying the same rent as you would for brand new units in the Franklin area that have more amenities.","If I could give zero stars I would.

112458774,"I lived at Rosemont Sq in Randolph, MA for a few years and recently was forced out; see below. Please consider offering more staff training when it comes to customer training. Also, residents should have a say on staff evaluations. The current management staff needs to hear the reviews from a different perspective. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. ----- My Experience at Rosemont It's hard to base a decision on where to live based on another person's review. Everyone's experience is different but here is my experience. Neighbors will vary from building to building, but we were fortunate to have had a great group of people in our building that looked out for each other. From picking up packages for others to helping others shovel cars out made that part of our stay a good one. When it comes to Maintenance and Management, this is where our experience takes a turn. In the 4-5yrs we were there, it's been nothing but a headache with the two departments (There are a few good people on staff. Community manager joshua isn't one. He's just rude and snobby. And Asst Mgr, Tylar-Rose is clueless). No communication between staff and residents, staff throwing each other under the bus, disrespectful management staff, lack of urgency by staff with maintenance and management issues. That's just a few things we've personally experienced in our time there. There was a time where the entire building didn't have hot water for about 5 days. There were no messages from management on the matter. Maintenance was the only way to get any information. Daily phone calls grew tiring and they simply said management was not going to pay for the part to fix the water heater because it cost too much. That prompted the residents in the building to make calls to the corporate office, local town office and local tv station to let them know what was going on. A day later, the hot water was back. Over the years owners and community managers have changed and not for the better. After a lease renewal raise of $400 (Per Comm Mgr Joshua > increase to push folks out for remodeling), along with the constant trash, speeding cars, and snow removal issues we gave our notice, said goodbye and never looked back.","I lived at Rosemont Sq in Randolph, MA for a few years and recently was forced out; see below.

112485028,"If you are thinking of renting with any of their properties run. Run and don't look back. I have lived in The Netherlands Apartments for a little under a year for school. The apartments look alright over a 15-30 minute showing, but EVERYTHING is cheap and low quality (everything) appliances break, the floor and walls scuff unbelievably easily, and our fridge doesn't even have proper feet, some genius just folded a bunch of cardboard and stuck it underneath (makes the fridge rock unsettlingly and I can't pull it out to clean behind) to name just a few things. You can also expect ridiculous $150+ monthly heating bills in the winter (I even made sure to keep my door closed at all times from the rest of the apartment and let all of the other rooms be cold) I had to resort to leaving the heat on during the day while studying and then turning the heat off while I was in classes and at night and waking up to actual near freezing temperatures in my room to get the bills under control; you will likely get similar prices for air conditioning in the summer, if you decide to get air conditioning in the first place (not provided in any way shape or form by property managers). Our apartment didn't even come with window coverings... which wouldn't be too bad except that this includes the fucking bathroom not even having opaque windows, all of your neighbors (which can easily see into your windows by the way) will be able to see you get in and out of the shower or sitting on the toilet until you do something about it. The company is sketchy as hell to, they have multiple ""addresses"" where they supposedly have offices. The address they list in all communications (222 S Manoa Road) is also listed as the address for a completely different company (and the building doesn't look big enough to house multiple offices). Their other address (5100 Township Line Road) which is listed on the ZanderCo website (they rebranded to Brick Management to try and get away from the notorious reputation they built up) website looks fake as well. At the time of this review I have not personally made the potentially two hour plus journey to see the office for myself, but when looking on google street view there is nothing at all that indicates there is a property management office at that address. Oh and they have an automatic renewal clause in their lease that requires you to give notice a full 120 days before your lease expires, and if notice isn't given they just automatically renew your lease (happened to me and my room mate). After trying to reason with management we were given the ""extremely kind option"" to terminate early, which if you do will require you to stay in the apartment for 60 more days (paying rent of course), will cost you an additional two months rent in damages and you forfeit your security deposit. Like holy shit.... But the real problem is the management, the communication channels with management are designed to be as anti-tenant as possible. All communications go through this one old lady who does not give a shit about you. If you send an email you will most likely be ignored, if you put in a maintenance request you might get ignored (they did fix my broken from the start window in two days in late November once I threatened to withhold rent) I say might because on multiple times my room mate and I put in a request and it was marked as completed without someone from maintenance even entering the apartment to check on the problem. They even ignore clauses in their own lease. In the lease it clearly states that the landlord will not unreasonably withhold allowance to sublet the apartment but when my room mate and I tried to pursue that action we were told that ""upper management didn't want to allow subletting at this time"" and were refused any further reason as to why we couldn't. tl:dr Brick Management doesn't have tenants. You will not be humans to them, you will be sponges they squeeze water out of once a month (unless they tack on some made up $300 fine, that also happened to me and my neighbors). They are unscrupulous, scummy landlords that prey on students and low income individuals (they have lots of other negative reviews and even a news story about how terrible they are, just google Brick Management or ZanderCo).

Recently moved into my boyfriend's apartment here and was added to his lease when it expired. After we both did all the paperwork and signed the new lease, he kept getting calls about how if he didn't sign the lease, he'd get charged month to month. Once they finally got there **** together with that, they only charged him $8 on the first. He paid it, thinking he had previous credit from the last year of living here. (Previous roommate had pets we are no longer paying for, last time the lease renewed he had a credit, etc.) Paid and done on the first what he said he owed like every month. A week later while seeing family out of town, he checked it again to make sure and we had late fees and a new total. They had messed up, added it later, and didn't bother to notify us they they fixed or adjusted it. They wouldn't drop the late fee for their mistake when we called but we paid it anyway. Then we come home two days later to an eviction notice on the door for not having paid rent even though we did two days prior and with late fees. Which, even with the late fees, is MORE than what our lease says we owe. (Which we were only able to see after we got back in town and didn't have access to on the first.)

Based on this information, I, the perspective tenant, made relocation arrangements which included: (1) giving a 30 days-notice to current landlord; (2) moving expensive (gas, food, lodging, storage costs, notarization of Fieldstone Apartments rental documents and fax services, and a total of $495.00 for move-in cost to the unit as described [Dartmouth Dr.]); an additional cost of $650.00 for early termination of lease agreement (Northern, CA [a request to change the new lease date to 8/10/2015 was denied by Blair S. of Fieldstone Apartment]); and (3) as of 7/4/15, a daily lodging cost of $139.95 (discovered that the unit was not only not ready for new occupancy-but the condition of the unit was imply deplorable, a potential health risk. 
	
In that, carpets through-out the unit have not been sanitized; in fact, large stains were widespread, with smells of mold and mildew; the tub and exterior of the refrigerator had not been cleaned; the carpet in the entrance (front door) and front closet are also heavily soiled; the front door facing is covered with spider webs and other insects, in addition to what appears to be large oil spills, flanking the entrance of the door's concrete floor; the stairs leading to the unit are grossly covered with various large oil stains and other greasy spots combined with spiders webs and various insects' housings.

The patio storage door could not be opened (locks rusted), and it took several attempts to open the front door because, again, the locks were old and rusted.   The unit's condition is indicative of slum-lords situations or mass government housing units (poorly managed), a disturbing sight. Over a dozen pictures were taken.  The hope is that the City of Memphis, state and local agencies, will investigate the situation.

It is for visitors in case they stay overnight, because cars can be towed away if they don't have a special sticker provided by apartment management. Once I forgot to lock my vehicle and in the morning noticed my GPS and a jacket were stolen. So I never forget to lock it anymore. One annoying thing is the small cockroaches that are hard to eradicate, even when pest control supposedly have a monthly spray scheduled. They are not that many, but a few show up now and then. Easy to kill because they seem groggy by the poison. One other bad thin is that people with pets doesn't seem to care much about picking up after their furry friends.

Well....fast forward, i moved in...and it was horrible. THey came out a few times...but really did nothing about it. I spent money on commercial ozone machine to get smoke smell out...cleaning supplies....etc...and it got a little better..but nothing worked. After getting sick for the 2nd time ...i asked to move into another unit and i was told i could not. I have emails to prove this. I even offered to pay for moving (which i should not have had to do) BEFORE I moved in i told one of the leasing agents that i did not have dogs....but that once or twice while living here...i may have to watch my x-wife's dogs for a few days. SHe said OK...it shouldn't be a problem. Fast forward a bit.....i had the dogs for about 3 days..and i get an email from Lorri (the manager) saying that she is charging me $600 for having dogs in the unit...says it's in the lease. So..i told her that i was granted permission by one of her agents. She said...too bad....it's in the lease. THe lease says that i have to notify them within 10 days if i intend to add a dog to the lease....Well...i wasn't adding a dog to the lease....i was granted permission by their agent since it was such a short period.

Third of all when the manager of the apartment complex showed us an exact ""replica"" of the same apartment we would be moving into....surprisingly when we firat moved in the living room had a huge brick wall when the example we saw did not. Fourth of all my boyfriend and I wanted to get a pet to start a little fanily so we called somebody that workes in the office and asked if it was okay to have a dog and girl said yes it was so we went lollypop and bought a puppy. We called the manager of the complex the day after we got the puppy and asked when was a good time to drop off the $200 down deposit...she calls us back telling us that dogs are not allowed and apologized that we were misinformed from the previous girl because she was ""new"". All the manager said was that either we could find our puppy a second home or transfer to another apartment that would allow it with a $450 transfer fee. Thankgod we found the puppy a second home. The manager was not willing to talk things over at all over the phone or trying to negotiate anything especially because theres nothing in the lease agreement that says no pets allowed...Let alone the apartments are not up to date at all. The doors and windows are old and the kitchen cabinets are very old as well. Paying $675 a month with no utilities included is a little too pricey. The only reason we moved here was because it was five minutes down the road from where we work.

These were three big ones for our active lifestyle. And the apartment itself looked nice on tour. But... Once we moved in reality started to hit...half the gym equipment didn't work and we ended up having to go elsewhere. Garbage disposal broke and we had a moat in our kitchen sinks for 3 weeks before maintenance finally showed up only for it to happen again a couple months later. Finally, they replaced the old one. The closet doors were falling off their tracks, we'd call maintenance and it would take days, sometimes weeks for them to show. They'd rig the doors, but never truly fix them and we were charged upon exit. The window screens and frames basically crumbling, maintenance never came and I can't imagine how much extra we spent on heating and air because of it. And yep, we were charged upon exit. Half the time our maintenance request for any repair went unresolved and when we followed up they said our request wasn't even on the books. Hmmmm. We couldn't get out of here fast enough so we put in a notice at 90 days and ask what do we need to sign or fill out. They said nothing and that we were good, but upon exit they said we didn't fillout a written notice and that we'd be charged for another month. We asked to speak to a manager about the obvious mistake and a very long horror story short, the management was absolutely disrespectful and said it was our mistake. We were again charged. As much as we are laid back and give people the benefit of the doubt this place has earned this sad review. And to be honest, this is just a handful of our bad experience here.

1651692,"I lived here for many years while growing up, and then ended up getting an apartment with my now husband. I used to like it here, but things have changed.
Living in the front of the complex is better than living in the back. They put all the disgraceful tenants in the back and it's like a circus when the weather is nice.
I lived in the front though. In the back, it is so loud. People allow their kids to act like morons and leave their toys ALL over the place. I'm not prejudice, but you're lucky if you have an American neighbor.
Maintenance was usually good when I had a problem, but their maintenance staff has changed and I'm not a fan of a few of them. When my AC stopped working once, the one guy said that it was *only* 84 degrees in my apartment, as if that wasn't too hot. We were dying and my dog actually got sick because he was so over-heated. Most times they came and fixed the problem quickly though.
We had many problems with our heat and AC not working almost every single season which was beyond frustrating.
As others have stated, the windows suck. Since I lived there from ages 5-23, I lived there when the windows were installed new. I was very young at the time. Now, air just flows right through them and that results in a high electric bill in the summertime. Luckily heat is included in your rent, but you will probably need it turned up quite high and running often to get it warm enough since there are cold drafts blowing in. 
I moved out of my one bedroom in the front because we had an Indian couple living above us who had a toddler that they weren't supposed to have in a one bedroom. At 10-midnight when I would go to bed, they would be in their bedroom playing with their kid and basically having a social hour. Their kid would also wake up in the middle of every single night SCREAMING at the top of her lungs (literally like she was being murdered). It got so bad that I actually couldn't sleep through the night anymore and my nerves were completely shot. I complained and the apartments acted like they were going to do something about them since they were living there with more tenants than allowed. Months later, they were still living above us and we just decided to find somewhere else to live. We couldn't take it anymore.
I wrote a letter to management and everything. I think it's totally unfair that they were accommodating people that were breaking the rules, while I was doing what I was supposed to be doing, and suffering all the while.
When you move, you need to give a certain amount of times notice to get your security deposit. Luckily, I complained enough to the point where I was able to get out of there ASAP and still get my deposit back.
None of this is exaggerated, BELIEVE ME.
It used to be a great place to live, but now.... not so much. Maybe for those that have good reviews, they have better neighbors in their buildings, or live in a quieter section of the complex.","I lived here for many years while growing up&#44; and then ended up getting an apartment with my now husband.

111899506,"We moved to Desert Winds Patio Homes March of 2012. We chose this place due to the pristine grounds well kept and primarily retirement age tenants, though this is not specified as a retirement community. The Chamber of Commerce highly recommended this community. We saw how strict the management was here to ensure good tenants and a picturesque place to live. We were told that rents had not been going up yearly, also a good thing to know on a fixed income. Pet friendly was important to us and for a small extra fee a month and security deposit, we were happy to move in and comfortable living in such a wonderful community.
Fast forward to 2016. Rent has gone up every year. We have gone through at least 5-6 maintenance people since we have lived here. Now, we do not have one on a regular basis. Word from tenants and from maintenance personnel is that there is extreme difficulty working for the manager. To be fair, we liked the fact management is tough here but now we understand so much more why the consensus is so negative. 
The office always had a manager in it or a sub M-S 9-5. Now the office is closed on weekends and no forwarding number to call if something in the townhouse breaks or is in need of repair. Days there is to be a manager in the office, often you find the door locked and only sometimes is the CLOSED or WILL BE BACK  sign up on the door. When you call the office when it is open, rarely are you called back timely or without an attitude. This manager manages more than one property and likely has to split time between DWPH and the other place of business.
In 2012 we had gardeners come once a week and do the entire 44 units in one day and they did a superb job. The grounds looked manicured and things were not dying. Right now we have 2 large trees standing at an angle and the 1st god wind we have they both will fall causing either structural damage or causing bodily harm to a tenant coning out their door. 
Now we have a different company that does only part of the community gardening each week and a unsatisfactory job. Many trees and bushes have died  while weeds are taller than a 2 year old child and dead debris all over clogging the drip systems. Dead trees and bushes take months before they are replaced. The entrance to the water is in our yard and constantly the gate is left open or unlocked. We have 2 dogs, 1 blind. 
Too many times our driveway has been blocked by other vehicles and we cannot get out. Trucks and broken down cars with oil pans beneath the carriage catching drainage sit for months on the street until the tires on the vehicle are flat. 
Pesticide is sprayed monthly and both our dogs have gotten ill and we have had allergic reactions to being sprayed so often; I might add we have had -0- pest problems with not being sprayed. There too, the company 1st used that was so good no longer is the one used and a lesser quality one is now been hired. When asked not to spray our unit due to our illnesses, we need to stand outside and be sure they do not spray. If we do not watch them and they have asked us not to remind them each month as it is the same person-they spray us anyway.
Bottom line; with continual rent increases and poorer and poorer maintenance, gardening, pesticide people and escalating difficulty to trying to communicate with the negative management that is not easy to get in touch with; think twice if you are considering moving in to Desert Winds Patio Homes","We moved to Desert Winds Patio Homes March of 2012.

Even though you could be dealing with a serious issue in your townhome, she will not answer emails or return phone calls. This kind of attitude is very risky and both the manager and Park Avenue of Wayzata can be held responsible for lack of concern responding to residents issues. Next the rental is extremely high and they hike it every year. I dont mind paying the rent if the Townhomes were well maintained and equipped with good appliances. All the appliances are old and horrible(no one will take them for free). The townhome doesnt even come with a microwave. You have molds growing on the patio and they dont even pressure wash it. All your requests will fall on deaf ears. ******Caution: Make sure you take pictures when you move in and when you move out. INSIST that the managemt does an inspection with you prior to moving out and handing them the keys. Get a signed copy after they have done the moving out inspection. This property will charge you atrocious charges even if you leave it in excellent condition. As per Minnesota state law, the resident has every right to demand a move out inspection prior to handing the keys to the property. Protect your rights or else they will rip you when you move out. This property is in demand for rent not because its fantastic but there arent any rental townhomes other than this one in the Plymouth area. This is the main reason why Park Avenue of Wayzata doesnt care about the welfare of its tenants. If there were more competion perhaps then they might update the third world country appliances. Hopefully they atleast take the time to read the review and improve their services and attitude and care for the welfare of their residents as they are paying a very high rent for getting a third class service.

112353358,"My Experience: As a former employee of this apartment complex at evergreen commons I was so happy to work with the company. However things started to change very fast each day. I worked LATRICE being my manager and it was very taunting and stressful. I'm am a person who respect everyone and the things she would try to make me do unethical was past wrong and against my morals. I watched Latrice call tenants BITCHES, HOES, AND UGLY while working for this property. I remember a older lady who kept on coughing coming in to sign her lease, the woman was nice and Latrice said she didn't want the lady to move in because she was doing to much coughing and she was ugly. It hurts my heart to hear the comments that came out her mouth about the tenants and applicants that would come into the the leasing office. I would go into my office and Cry my eyes out because I have never seen anyone be so mean to people that is paying her salary. Latrice would make statements like "" I will beat a bitch ass and blame it on my bipolar disorder"". Need to say the less if you are suffering from any disorder and you intentionally use that to hurt or make threats to a human that is sooooo wrong on Many levels. I remember the day when I ask her why one tenant is not paying a 300 legal fee and she have made over 80 people pay the 300 legal fee. She told me if I charge him the legal fee like everyone else she would terminate me and she ended the conversation with "" you need to mind your damn business"". Seeing how she discriminated against tenants was beyond wrong also. If one don't have to pay the legal fee no tenant should have to pay the legal fee of 300 dollars. Beside people have been evicted because of none payment and late payment and if you file eviction on one person you must file on all according to fair housing. She told one tenant that the reason the other guy doesn't pay the 300 legal fee is that it's a disable accommodation, well if that's the case everyone on the property with a disability should should have that same accommodation which they don't. Latrice need to be reported to her regional manager for wrongful actions. How could one person be so evil to other people it's so wrong. I'm so happy to not be working there with her anymore. but i feel so bad for the tenants that suffer because of her attitude. She even tried to make me lie on a tenant saying that she ran in the office and dropped her money off to try to get the tenant evicted however I Latrice took the tenant money and wanted to re file eviction on the tenant after taking her money. I attached a photo of the screen shot when she tried to get me to lie on the tenant because she knew with her taking the lady money the case would be dismissed. Look at the text message of this evil lady sent me. She even made me and the staff donate money to a Leaseing agent after the Leaseing agent was caught stealing tenants rent. That's crazy I loved the Leaseing agent that did it she was nice but why do you take collecting from someone who steals from your company.

Need to say the less if you are suffering from any disorder and you intentionally use that to hurt or make threats to a human that is sooooo wrong on Many levels. I remember the day when I ask her why one tenant is not paying a 300 legal fee and she have made over 80 people pay the 300 legal fee. She told me if I charge him the legal fee like everyone else she would terminate me and she ended the conversation with "" you need to mind your damn business"". Seeing how she discriminated against tenants was beyond wrong also. If one don't have to pay the legal fee no tenant should have to pay the legal fee of 300 dollars. Beside people have been evicted because of none payment and late payment and if you file eviction on one person you must file on all according to fair housing. She told one tenant that the reason the other guy doesn't pay the 300 legal fee is that it's a disable accommodation, well if that's the case everyone on the property with a disability should should have that same accommodation which they don't. Latrice need to be reported to her regional manager for wrongful actions. How could one person be so evil to other people it's so wrong. I'm so happy to not be working there with her anymore. but i feel so bad for the tenants that suffer because of her attitude. She even tried to make me lie on a tenant saying that she ran in the office and dropped her money off to try to get the tenant evicted however I Latrice took the tenant money and wanted to re file eviction on the tenant after taking her money. I attached a photo of the screen shot when she tried to get me to lie on the tenant because she knew with her taking the lady money the case would be dismissed. Look at the text message of this evil lady sent me. She even made me and the staff donate money to a Leaseing agent after the Leaseing agent was caught stealing tenants rent.

112353358,"My Experience: As a former employee of this apartment complex at evergreen commons I was so happy to work with the company. However things started to change very fast each day. I worked LATRICE being my manager and it was very taunting and stressful. I'm am a person who respect everyone and the things she would try to make me do unethical was past wrong and against my morals. I watched Latrice call tenants BITCHES, HOES, AND UGLY while working for this property. I remember a older lady who kept on coughing coming in to sign her lease, the woman was nice and Latrice said she didn't want the lady to move in because she was doing to much coughing and she was ugly. It hurts my heart to hear the comments that came out her mouth about the tenants and applicants that would come into the the leasing office. I would go into my office and Cry my eyes out because I have never seen anyone be so mean to people that is paying her salary. Latrice would make statements like "" I will beat a bitch ass and blame it on my bipolar disorder"". Need to say the less if you are suffering from any disorder and you intentionally use that to hurt or make threats to a human that is sooooo wrong on Many levels. I remember the day when I ask her why one tenant is not paying a 300 legal fee and she have made over 80 people pay the 300 legal fee. She told me if I charge him the legal fee like everyone else she would terminate me and she ended the conversation with "" you need to mind your damn business"". Seeing how she discriminated against tenants was beyond wrong also. If one don't have to pay the legal fee no tenant should have to pay the legal fee of 300 dollars. Beside people have been evicted because of none payment and late payment and if you file eviction on one person you must file on all according to fair housing. She told one tenant that the reason the other guy doesn't pay the 300 legal fee is that it's a disable accommodation, well if that's the case everyone on the property with a disability should should have that same accommodation which they don't. Latrice need to be reported to her regional manager for wrongful actions. How could one person be so evil to other people it's so wrong. I'm so happy to not be working there with her anymore. but i feel so bad for the tenants that suffer because of her attitude. She even tried to make me lie on a tenant saying that she ran in the office and dropped her money off to try to get the tenant evicted however I Latrice took the tenant money and wanted to re file eviction on the tenant after taking her money. I attached a photo of the screen shot when she tried to get me to lie on the tenant because she knew with her taking the lady money the case would be dismissed. Look at the text message of this evil lady sent me. She even made me and the staff donate money to a Leaseing agent after the Leaseing agent was caught stealing tenants rent.

She gave us a tour that really excited us to join the community. After she gave us the initial information, it was like we dropped off the face of the earth as there was minimal contact. We had to dig our own information out. Directions for payments were vague prior to moving in. Emails that were never responded to. I went to visit the place myself to get some information and sure enough, Vanessa didn't know who I was or even remembered what part of the process I was on. I basically had to remind her that we are supposed to move in on 9/10 and inquired how to sign the lease agreement. It wasn't until we made contact with Megan who helped us through the process. Additionally, we were told we would have 2 closets in our bedroom which was one of the main reasons we chose 6103, but come to find out that we don't have an extra closet in the bedroom. When we toured a similar room, it had 2 bedrooms and 1 of them had 2 closets. Vanessa advised us that we would have the 1 bedrooms with 2 closets which we were okay with because we had only planned on 1 bedroom. A tad misleading. 

Also, very disappointed that we were never contacted to come view our apartment area until the day we moved in. This created unnecessary work for me since I now have to request maintenance.  I am disappointed that my key does NOT work properly and I have to ""JIMMY"" the key to open the door. Small issues usually are the ones that hold the most amount of weight long term. I expected more with what I am paying monthly. Had it been a $800 apartment, I wouldn't be so much to dissect these issues, but since I'm paying just shy of $1300, I would expect some professionalism to some degree.","So far, I am not impressed with the coordinators.

1684305,"Kim Jong Un s daughter has reportedly moved to Spokane Valley and now works as an apartment manager here at Montgomery Court Apartments.  Carie  aka Junior  had joined our little community back in January and since then has done nothing but make all the residents resent signing a 1 year lease.
Since Kim Jong Junior s arrival she has took it upon herself to devise a plan to dismiss all the competent employees here only leaving herself in charge, indispensable, and so no one can monitor her lack of work.  With Junior s,  do as I say not as I do  attitude she spends most of her time not in the office but at her home (that is mostly paid for by the tenants rent) spending her time making up new rules so as to disguise the fact that no real work is getting done. If you re in your male and in your 20 s you ll find that you re her friend and you don t have to follow her rules along with you getting invited for dinner. 
To look at the front of the property is very pleasant, but in order to keep her monthly bonus checks coming the rest of the grounds look like crap. It took over 2 months for her to have someone remove poison ivy from common areas where children play. The ivy was actually growing into the vinyl siding of the building and stood over seven feet tall. One tenant has been waiting over a month for a $40.00 handle to be replaced. When you inquire about the repairs, you re told  it s not in this month s budget .  Junior has even tried to cancel the amount of times the garbage is picked up leading to rodents in the trash, just so she can get a bigger check.
Junior has had four young adults  non-leased  tenants living with her now for 3 months,  over the 14 day limit we have to follow  she allows them to use storages units, and car ports at no charge. She also has been seen removing tenants discarded items from the trash bin and using them to d cor the apartment in where she and the five others live.
Multiple cars have been broken into, one car was stolen, and one home invasion and burglary. Along with other problems on the property. Junior has also made comments on how she is going to make this a child free zone and try her hardest not to renew the leases of pet owners.
I personally care too much for my family s well-being to stay here under the  NEW MANAGEMENT  and will be breaking my lease. It s sad too because I use to enjoy living here. I just don t understand how the owner of Montgomery Court can pay someone for NOT doing a good job and letting the property go to crap.

112282824,"I've lived at the AMP  for about a month now. Overall, I enjoy living at the AMP and would recommend it to those looking for a luxury apartment complex in the historic Clifton area. The location is unmatched, you are only 2 miles away from Bardstown road, waterfront park, and NULU area, and only 3 miles from St. Matthews area. Not to mention you are directly on Frankfort Avenue, within walking distance of some fantastic bars and restaurants.The apartment itself is very modern feeling with quartz counter tops through out, modern light fixtures and fans, and dark wooded floors and cabinets. Maintenance has responded promptly and professionally to all of my (some a bit petty) requests. Front desk staff is always ready to answer any questions or concerns you may have, and the people of the amp have been very friendly so far. The community is smoke free and pet friendly. There isn't much green space in the community but there is a little park not even a half mile down the road which is great if you have a pet who needs a bit more space. 

Now for the bad stuff. If you need fast and reliable internet or cell service while at home you may want to look elsewhere. You are charged $85 per month (required) for DISH network (125 channels) and 50 mb/s internet. You DO NOT get gigabit internet like advertised on the AMP website unless you want to pay an additional $109 per month ($194 total, AT&T fiber and Google Fiber are $70 and $85, respectively, by comparison). This was never mentioned to me by the staff and I only found out when I called Xiber (who is based in Hawaii btw) on the first day to address our internet connection which was inching by at a measly 1-8 mb/s. Luckily we were able to get it resolved with a new router Xiber sent and it was at least at the advertised 50 mb/s speed. That is until we had a storm, and now it is back down to 1 mb/s. So it's very unreliable and Xiber is extremely difficult to get a hold of to get anything resolved. (Probably because they are based in Hawaii lol) Also, I have AT&T and my roommate has Sprint and we both have basically no cell service in our apartment on the first floor, adding to the internet issue.

So to wrap things up, the AMP does offers some enticing options with its great location, responsive maintenance & front desk staff, modern apartment styling, and community; so if those things are most important to you then you should take a tour. However, if internet speeds and reliability is a priority to you and you are wanting to do more than stream Netflix at 480p, then you may want to look around a bit more.","I've lived at the AMP  for about a month now.

My son is a 24 year old young man with Fragile X Syndrome, a genetic form of Autism, who was looking for his very first apartment after living in a group home for 6 years. Swan Lake was the cheapest in Carrollwood and close by family and friends. He and a roommate went in with their supported living coaches to look at an apartment. They decided that this is where they wanted to live, so they sat down to fill out an application. Prior to filling out the application, the coaches made sure that the staff at the apartments new that my son and his roommate would need a guarantor because they don't make the required 3 times the monthly rent. The application process took about a week because all the paperwork had to be gathered and submitted and in that week, the supported living coaches and I repeatedly told them that the guys would need a guarantor. My son and his roommate paid the non-refundable application fees and administrative fee ($250 total) and were then told that the apartment complex only accepts guarantors for students and the elderly who are receiving Social Security benefits. At that time they could have given back the money because the application had not yet been submitted. Instead, they assured us that they would work it out. They came back the next day denying the application because the guys don't make the required income. We again told them that we intended to use a guarantor and they told us that their policy doesn't allow them to accept a guarantor for them. They kept the money though. I went in the next day and explained to them that their policy violates the Fair Housing Act. Catherine, the apartment manager, said they were sorry, but that's their policy. I told her I would be filing a complaint with HUD. Later that day, Catherine called me and said they would ""make an exception "" for my son and his roommate. No thanks. They knew they were not welcome there and would not consider living there after the way they were initially treated. It's shameful that in this day and age that discriminatory things like this still happen.","If I could give this place less than a 1 star rating, I would.

I found living there tantamount to having a horrifying reoccurring nightmare. The list of issues that exist on that complex - from steady property deterioration to completely ineffective garbage disposal - resembles that of a 747 passenger manifest. Much of the element who are now allowed to rent there are pathetic. Drug dealers are commonplace. The turnover rate in residents is much higher than the average. To add insult to injury, the property manager is a pitiful human being; amiability is clearly not her forte, and it doesn't take a doctorate in psychology to clearly see she suffers from a major personality disorder. Fortunately, the other two women she has working with her in the office are extremely warm and helpful, as are the maintenance people. It became readily clear to both my husband and me that the corporation that owns Cypress Shores is far more focused on its standing on Wall Street than Main Street. But none of this is a concern for me any longer. My purpose in writing this review is to prevent it from becoming one for those of you currently looking for an apartment.

The tow truck company that the building uses never actually comes to tow people out of your spot so you are just screwed. Oh yeah, they are not renewing my lease so they can raise the rent by $400. It looks like they are trying to attract broes by putting cornhole outside. This place has a lot of character that in their greed, they are stripping away. If you want to belong to a community and have a sense of security, I would look somewhere else. Oh, and there are homeless people everywhere digging through your trash.

However in the end is when things go wrong. When we were moving out the apartment condition was the same as when we moved in. We are extremely clean and well maintained people as is our home. I went in an paid the balance in the end as agreed and I verified with the property manager that we didn't have to walk through the apartment with them. They said no that everything was perfect. Well....fast forward about four months and my brother and I both got a collection notice for about $975. When we called to find out what was going on they said the carpets were damaged. Well, naturally we disputed this and never heard anything back for months. When attempting to speak to a property manager your call and call and call with no response. You go in in person and nobody is there to help you. If you are going to charge someone for something you need to make an effort to communicate an issue if there is one. At that time is when you need to come up with a proper resolution before moving forward with sending someone to collections. Then we get a big hit on our credit. We call back again and they said they are willing to settle for $300, the collection agency. Too late. The damage has been done. Credit score dropped from 821 to 691 in one night. Now this will be on our credit for up to 7 years because of these people not doing what THEY were supposed to do. I will be filling suit. Thank you Bozuto for your EXCELLENT service and ruining my chances to buy a house that I have already made an offer on.","Don&apos;t believe what these people tell you.

112079829,"I lived in these apartments for a year 2016-2017 and my rent was $650 for 2br 1bath .  My experience was not all that great with this place.  I was always getting sick in these apartments due to the lack of circulating air(very stagnant so your breathing in the same air alllllllll the time), dust quickly collects so you have to keep up with dusting or else you have an inch build up before you know it and the paint job is so old that the land lord warned us to not lick it or chip it becasue it contained lead and  asbestos (carcinogen) which is very bad for your health. During the winter months I had a leak in my bathroom ceiling, all maintenance did was come in and plugged it up with cloth towels and didn't come back for another week and half to look/fix the leak more.  The walls are super thin, you can hear your neighbors crystal clear as if they were in the same apartment as you or anyone outside and especially living by winco you will hear them unloading trucks at the crack of dawn if you live in the E building. I've had disruptive neighbors knocking at 5 in the morning asking for drugs and someone was gonna ""get him"". Every so often I will hear my door knob jiggling as if someone was trying to see if it was unlocked.  The landlord does try and do a good job with the circumstances that were giving to her. I've had two landlords in the span of a year. They were both super nice.  The floor plan is pretty big and that's what I loved about this place considering rent was on the lower end.  The rooms were alll very decently sized and spread out but that created some hot rooms since the ac doesn't reach all the way to the back rooms. There was a mistake on a check (security deposit) and was a nightmare to get the check fixed (still currently dealing with it) . Corporate will not reach back out to you like they say they will.

Logan was the manager at the time and he is honestly the best manager we've ever had at any place we have lived. He made this place seem like a tropical paradise, despite the fact that it's just a tiny little apartment complex next to a busy street. We were all happy, and by all I mean every single other person I talked to that lived here loved it. When Logan got transferred up to salt lake, he was replaced with Lisa, who again was wonderful. She did anything and everything she could do to make sure that everyone enjoyed living here, and for the most part, everyone did. Then Lisa moved on, and we got Amy.................................. Amy is rude, Amy is scatterbrained, Amy commits illegal acts, and basically doesn't give a shit about anybody that lives here. Amy gave our apartment number to a family that was stalking, harassing, and threatening me, my wife, and our kids. When I came down to talk to her about it she said that the cameras in the complex ""just so happened to go down that morning"" so that we couldn't see on the cameras how they went to the office first, then to our apartment. Amy misplaced our 2 month notice that we were moving out. I had called to just make sure that we were still good to move out when it had been a month and a half since I left it in the office and she told me she wouldn't honor it because she didn't have it. I asked her for her supervisors information, but she just wouldn't give it to me and I had to call up Lisa (the old manager) and get it from her. She then retaliated and sent me a letter to vacate. I spoke with another resident who randomly got a notice to vacate, despite the fact that they have never paid rent late. He went in to speak with her about it, and she just said to contact their lawyer, and he would explain why. When he called the lawyer, the lawyer had no clue, and had just been asked to fill out the paperwork, so he was sent back to talk to Amy, who again wouldn't tell them. We have had a broken screen door for 6 months, and had asked her 5 months ago if it could get replaced. After about 2 months, somebody finally came to look at it...it took 2 freaking months just for her to finally send maintenance to look at it, that's unacceptable. This place isn't TOO bad. It is in a great location, it does have some ok amenities, and the rent isn't crazy high (it's still kind of high). Right now though, you do NOT want to move in here, not with who we currently have as the manager. As long as Amy is here, for your own sanity, stay away.","I used to love this community.

I live in a two bedroom, lower level which means I have a really good size eat in kitchen...most apartments have a galley kitchen which are way too small.  The kitchen and separate dining area both have nice windows.  In fact, all the windows appear to be new.  The living room accommodates my furniture nicely and the patio is much bigger than some of the ones at other complexes.  The bathroom is very spacious and the shower pressure is great...no trickling, low flow showers here.
Really nice size master bedroom and the second bedroom is now my tv room and again a really good size.  Plenty of closet space.  The apartments also feature private entrance and mail delivered at your front door.  With windows in the front and back the ventilation makes for a nice breeze and I only use the a/c on 90  days.  I have a full size washer and dryer which is very convenient.  For those apartments that don't have a washer/dryer there are separate facilities on the property close to all apartments.  Pets are allowed and with all apartments there is a pet deposit and monthly pet rent but every place has that so it's to be expected.
In addition, since I'm on the ground floor I can do some gardening in the front and the back which makes this seem more like a house than an apartment.  As with any apartment or house every now and then something needs fixing and the maintenance crew here is superb....usually a 1 to 2 day turnaround and they are very professional.  Have I mentioned the 2 pools, without an extra charge for residents and ability to bring guests for a very small fee.  The grounds are constantly maintained and as with everything in the realm of property...location, location, location, everything is just a few minutes away.  The office staff is very friendly and accommodating...so, if you're looking for a great place to call home...this is it.","This place is absolutely the best apartment that I have ever in.

The apartment manager was very helpful, putting us on the waiting list and calling us promptly when an apartment we liked opened up.  Rent was respectable although I understand it just increased.  We rented a 2 1 in their ""Phase 1"" area, therefore all utilities were covered and we paid only $1150 a month.  Deposit was a very nice $500.  The apartment itself was quite clean and well put together, we had an apartment with it's own balcony and stairwell which was very nice and private, although not the norm.  Appliances aren't too old and work well, rooms are spacious although the metal closet doors are a bit dated.  Bathroom was dated but for the most part pretty clean, although the towel rack coming off seems to be a recurring issue.  We only had repairs once and they were very timely.  Water seemed to get shut off for half a day almost every month due to a leak somewhere.  The pools and hottub are pretty nice although can be pretty chilly sometimes.  Can only get charter cable and maybe AT&T internet/phone.  Covered parking spot, lots of visitor parking, and a decent sized storage closet near the parking space. Mixed population of college students and families.  A number of elderly residents that keep to themselves.  Only seemed to be noisy during the summer break, during the fall months it was relatively quiet at all times.  Make sure the apartment manager is on your side.  She can make your life hell if you are a bad tenant.  She will find animals if you have them or let them visit, and she will have you fined.  We got along well and she never hassled me as long as I was respectful.  Mandatory carpet cleaning that they prefer to have done themselves, costs about $95 upon moveout that they deduct from your deposit.",Lived in Irish Hills for about 6 months&#44; needed something to tide myself and a friend over through the summer and fall while we finished our degrees at CalPoly.

I think they keep them open so the public can be parked and towed purposely. the security is excellent. they constantly walk around the grounds to check on things and with the added security from both stadiums you're pretty much in good hands. We never had an issue with any kind of vandalism or crimes. Our neighbors going up and down the stairs sounded like cattle being herded and it rattled our picture frames. If you have a 1 bedroom than be prepared to be cramped in your space because there is no storage in a 1 bedroom. Our door leaked at the top whenever it rained and you could see the streams running down in lines on the front door. our patio window and door are not on or sealed properly so I had to put towels down around the bottom so the rain didn't leak in and dry the carpet with a mildew smell. the maintenance workers are very reliable. They will do anything and everything for you and they are very polite about it. If something they fixed breaks a few days after, you can be sure they come back the next day to fix it.

112192876,"Since moving into Stoneridge in July, we have had a number of issues occur. The first week in our renovated apartment, our ceiling and light to our bathroom fell, almost hitting me. This was due to a leak in the ceiling and later the contractors admitted it was their fault due to one of the workers not installing a pipe to prevent the leak in the first place. Endless maintenance order on a brand new apartment. The week we moved in, we were unable to park in our assigned parking spot due to contractors leaving drywall, nails, doors etc in our assigned parking spot. The contractors did sleep in the apartments they were renovating and worked till 2 am some nights till we complained to the front office about it. they also smoked weed and cigarettes in a smoke-free community and while on the job. My husband's vehicle was stolen from the property, my bicycle was attempted theft from our back patio, and our neighbor's apartment was broken into and robbed in the afternoon. Multiple sketchy people riding bikes through the golf course at night. Stoneridge did not warn others about theft or home break-ins occurring. An email or poster posted around the neighborhood would have done well to notify us, but we had to hear it from our neighbors about the break-in and we had to let other neighbors aware of our vehicle being stolen from the property. Our maintenance orders were fulfilled in a timely manner but with the price of the apartment and them claiming to be a luxury apartment, they shouldn't have occurred in the first place. I emailed the property manager about terminating our lease without having to pay a fee because we were aware that two other tenants were able to break their lease without any termination fees for similar reasons to ours. Jennifer Blitch Executive Portfolio Manager emailed us back stating: While it is always our highest priority to make sure all residents have an enjoyable experience at Stoneridge Apartments we are very sorry yours has not been. Taking that into consideration, we are able to offer you’re a reduced Lease Termination fee in the amount of $XXXX. We don't understand how we have to pay half the termination fee when knowing other tenants did not have to. We are being treated unfairly. Never were we rude or inconsiderate when asking to terminate or when our property was stolen or having our ceiling fall. We waited patiently for six days for a response, even though we did call every day to see if there was an update. Moral of this review, don't move here. It doesn't feel safe and the parking is atrocious. Believe all the negative reviews for they are true. About the hummer being parked in the same spot for years, it was true. I checked the vehicle myself and it had expired tags and the vehicle was still there in November. If you have kids, DON'T MOVE HERE. Completely unsafe for you and your family. It is also not uncommon to see broken glass around the property from car break-ins. The only thing we liked about this place is the maintenance manager Jesus. He is the kindest, trustworthy person you'll come across. When we move, our dogs will miss him so much.","Since moving into Stoneridge in July, we have had a number of issues occur.

1164611,"So i haven't been in trouble at these apartments, however they do have a lot of problems and like others are saying management is not the best at all.  

They will be nice to you when showing you an apartment and try to get you to move in, only to turn around and ignore you and act very rude.  

First our family lived in a town home, they are nice but none have washer and dryers which means you use the laundry room.  Which is ok there is a lot of room in the townhomes, however the walls are thin and the air vents are horrible.  We lived in a townhome for a year and the neighbors on one side were constant smokers, who smoked both in and outside their home. 

 The smoke was comming through vents and into our townhome and management refused to do anything about the issue and insisted that we must have had a window open for the smoke to come in.  However some of the smoke smell was in the bathroom, which does not have windows and only vents.  The neighbors on the other side also smoked, which made the problem worse, they also liked to listen to music loudly into the early hours of the morning and very late at night.  

Two men lived there and one of them was cheating on his girlfriend i'm assuming because she came over multiple times between 2-4AM and screamed at him outside on his back patio which we could hear the whole time and on one ocassion the mistress was actually at the home and it turned into an altercation. 

 We told the management about it, and one time the girlfriend came over during the day and started screaming and the management actually came over and saw/heard the woman and part of our problem and told her she needed to leave, and they refused to do anything about it.  It turns out this girlfriend live in another apartment on the same complex.


So we thought we would move and try an apartment instead of a townhome, maybe it would be better, we'd have a washer/dryer in the apartment and get away from our problem neighbors.  We were willing to give management another chance and thought it was simply the area of the complex we were in.  So we moved to an apartment, they said the one we would be getting was being cleaned so we would have to view a different one so we did.  Well move in day rolled around and we went to look in the apartment.

First off the upstairs neighbors were blaring their music, you could hear it outside, and very clearly in the apartment, so we called management and they asked them to turn it down, which they did, so far a good start.  Then we walked in the livingroom and there looked like dog or cat poop smeared on the floor we told the management because it wasnt just a stain it was dried flaky, ect.  

They apologized and sent someone over to clean it while we were moving in, then there was a green mold growing in the cabinet, and pink and black molds growing in more than one window i also asked about this since it was suppose to be cleaned before we moved in and they just told me that the cleaning lady wasn't a very good one and that they had ""let her go"" and could send someone over to clean it but never did and i cleaned it.    


We've also had the problem with other's animals comming on our back patio, all dogs are suppose to be leashed but a lot of people do not do this, and do not clean up their dogs messes.  

The people who come to cut the grass and trim the trees will use a leaf blower right by your front door forcing dangerous gas smells in your home and they come right up on your patio and look at your things and pick them up and some of our neighbors have things missing.  

Parking is another issue we've had at both the apartment and townhome.  People will take your parking space and managment will place a tow sticker that says ""if you dont move in 72hours we will tow you"" but leaves you the resident out of a parking space especially if you get home late at night, YOUR designated parking space, not to mention that visitor spots fill up quickly too.  It doesn't do you a lot of good that they have 72 hours to move when you need YOUR apartment spot then.  Also other residents really do not park correctly they either park over the white line on your side, or 2-3 feet out in the driving lot, or there have been cases where perfectly healthy people park in the disabled spot and leave the elderly disabled people to park really far away from their homes, so inconsiderate people.


As for maintanence it is pretty quick that you get someone out to your apartment and he fixes the problem for you before he leaves.  However only one of the maintenance men actually does his job and he's pretty much left to run around the entire complex fixing problems while the other one just sits on his ass in the office.  


There is also an ant problem we have it at both the townhome and apartment complex.  They dont necessarily go after food either they just make a trail from the baseboard to the window and around your home.  I went and bought ant traps and put them up and called management and they said they would send and exterminator out.  Well he came and left a paper that said he set up traps for them and i couldnt find them.  I found the ones i set up, but not that the exterminator ""set up"" and i looked in every inch of the apartment for them.  


Even after we moved into the apartment black mold grew in the apartment in various spots we got mold cleaner but it was random places the livingroom, kitchen, room, bathroom, not even places that were wet necessarily.  


The swimming pool is another problem, there are rules posted however people do not follow them.  There are little kids running around the pool, and could easily slip and fall on their head.  Full grown men jump in the pool even though it's against the rules and splash everyone in the face.  Parents do not watch their children and let them be rude and inconsiderate to other residents and people with small children.  


They  tell you the tanning bed is free, then charge you for it.

People speed through the parking lot at 20   MPH even though the posted limit is 5MPH , EVEN the people who work here do it,we were almost hit comming around the corner.  


They tell you there are breed restrictions, and that your dog cannot be aggressive, however there are dogs that snap at you and bark aggressively when you walk by them.  Also i saw multiple people with restricted breeds, german shephers, pitbulls, pit mixes, dobermans, rotweilers, and more.  


Also during the winter time if it snows a lot or ices over it's exteremly hard to get up the steep hill or in your parking space.  They ocassionally salt one of the three driveways but none of the parking lots.  


They are not the only place in salem that has a no weight pet limit, and there are friendlier places out there.  

We were open to giving the staff here a chance, we werent trouble makers when we lived there and still were treated poorly, ignored, or told ""oh well.""  Now that we don't live there anymore we're much happier.  


So if you do plan on moving into these apartments go around and knock on some doors and talk to some people, or talk to people in the parking lot (more than one person, in different areas), find out which apartment will be yours if you move in and check out the neighbors and your future parking space and if people let their dogs run loose, come during the summer time and see how the activity at the pool is.  Get things in writing from management.


Who knows you could get lucky and move into an apartment or townhome here with good neighbors, where no one steals your parking space, and management takes care of any and all problems right away, but you should probably do your research throughly first.

1.I have lived in the original Avalon (not Avalon east across the street). I had a lot of problems with administration and their behaviour. 

2.I am a coloured person , my family is South Asian. 

3.While I never complained I disliked the rude inconsiderate behaviour 
of the "" African American"" residents of Avalon. I also noticed that other multiple ethnicities who lived in Avalon had an issue with rude black behaviour, we often talked about it. 

So I am issuing and open message to the residents of Avalon. Stop

3.While I never complained I disliked the rude inconsiderate behaviour 
of the &#34; African American&#34; residents of Avalon. I also noticed that other multiple ethnicities who lived in Avalon had an issue with rude black behaviour&#44; we often talked about it. 

So I am issuing and open message to the residents of Avalon. Stop
behvaing like n******. I am not white I totally sympathize with the  &#34;white guy&#34; on the elevator.

Once in the elevator&#44; I wanted to go up&#44; a bunch of &#34;African American&#34; kids blocked the elevator door&#44; and the parents did nothing about it....There seems to be a disease with rude behviour with African American residents of Avalon. 

In fact just so that this post won&#39;t get deleted&#44; I had to self-censor&#44; the  other incidents that  happened with African Americans... and I had to tone down what I really felt like saying about you.

111934195,"Location seems to be the usual mantra associated with realty in all it's forms.  However, one caveat to this cliche is structural considerations.  This is a VERY OLD looking structure which visually makes this extremely unappealing and disappointing for a potential tenant.  The outside buildings share a common walkway which serves as both a shared entrance and exit to each separate apartment.  In other words, this is modeled after the old motels which are designed to be two stories, top and bottom identical units, inside and out, providing a cheap sense of uniformity enabling maximum profits utilizing the less is more approach.

The monthly rental charge/fee was also exorbitant and overpriced for the the units themselves.  The upgraded units did not feature anything considered extravagant enough to warrant the extra cost.  In fact, after observing both upgraded and standard units, I saw little in the way of difference which could justify the expense.  This is especially true in light of the lack of amenities this community offers.  Having lived on both East & West coasts of Florida, I have become accustomed to the norm in these so-called gated communities with access to ample security, gym, community pool, lounge with billiards, BBQ grills and even a movie theater and library, let alone tennis & volleyball courts.  Boca Winds has none, except a small pool which seemed uninhabited, save for some listless retirees.

The place does offer convenience for shopping purposes but with no amenities in terms of utilities as the water bill is not included in the rent - You will pay more overall and gain very little in terms of quality and amenities which you find consistent throughout Florida within this price range.  In summation, for the same cost in rent which I was offered at the time, other places with a 15-20 mile radius offered so much more in terms of truly upgraded units as well as outstanding community features and amenities.  This was especially true of gated secure communities I looked at in both Boynton Beach and West Palm.  However, location as I alluded to in the onset of this review accounts for the variation.  Boca is simply not worth the cost, compared to what is the ""norm"" in terms of amenities and units within the same price range.  I for one am glad I did not end up with a 1 year lease as I had serious reservations about paying $1350+ with NO utilities included and zero community features.

If I wanted to stay at a Motel 6 in terms of visual appearances and lack of features, Boca Winds serves it's purpose save for the extravagant rental price.  Economic considerations aside, shop around as the rental market is abound with owners looking to profit over the abundance of tenants with bad credit, little income/savings, unstable and insecure   those with liquidity, good credit and flexibility have options.  In the end, location only applies to home owners as you reap the benefits due to geographic & subsequently, demographic appreciation.  Evidence of this is the surrounding area which is proliferated with ranch style 3/2 units surrounding Boca Winds.  Many are run down, dilapidated and feature original external options with zero renovations save for usual lawn care.  Location is what keeps these owners in the green.  Rentals and tenants do not have that option.  Rent smart and getting the most amenities for your cash is the key.  Boca Winds, unfortunately does not meet that expectation for a potential client or tenant at the price offered per unit with no amenities in comparison to what is ""Florida standard"" on both coasts...........C'est la vie.","Location seems to be the usual mantra associated with realty in all it&apos;s forms.

112151374,"I wouldn't recommend this place if I was homeless and it was rent free. First and foremost our gas and power sky rocketed tremendously in the summer. The office and maintenance claimed that it's because of the summer heat wave and how hot it has been consistently. Yes it was hot and a.c. kicked on more, but not $150-$200 hot. After 3-4 times of making this complaint the office staff manager Angie decided to come up with another load of excuses such as ""Your neighbor is paying about the same"" ""be glad you don't live at my house my bill was close to $300"" etc... all of which have nothing to do with where I live or my usage needs. You can't compare your usage to your neighbor or anyone else of that matter. Nice try Angie. Finally I got the maintenance guy to check our thermostat and it's accuracy. It was off by 6 degrees so it was never right and the a.c. would kick on thinking it was not cool enough because of this. I asked for a little bit of credit on my utilities for this malfunction. Again Angie came back with an elementary reply ""we don't know how long it was that way"" I said that should be part of your move in ready checklist as you cannot expect tenants to have the tools to check it themselves. This went on back and forth even to the point of rocky mountain power getting involved and wanting to do a conference call to show proof of the increase on our bill. By this time Angie was cornered and like a rat she bit back with "" your apartment always smells like weed and I could be a real b**** and call the cops."" Those were her exact words. Not addressing the real issue and trying to blackmail for me their lack of cleaning up apartments to be move in ready. I smell weed all the time outside and inside and also cigarettes but I'm not going to waste my time or energy talking about that to her. So if you want to be threatened and harassed for making maintenance requests sandpiper is for you. They have 0 scheduling coordination with any outside maintenance crew, they give the keys to your apartment to just about anyone with a clip board and uniform. My fiance and I have two little boys and their safety was a concern living here. My fiance finally got tired of them entering with no notice or a simple phone, call she slammed the door in their face. Angie had quite the tantrum over this, again not even considering that it was before 8 am and no notice or any sort or indication somebody would be entering that day.

111593260,"CROOKED. I moved to Tanglewood Apartments at 1920 E Grand Ave., Escondido, CA. 92027 in March of 2014. I paid $700 deposit and the rent was $1075.00 month. I signed a one year lease. The apartment they showed me was not the apartment they rented to me and the actual apartment I moved into was beyond ghetto. The entire time I lived there only 2 of the burners on the stove worked. The dishwasher door was only hinged on one side so whenever we opened the dishwasher door it felt like it was going to come off. The refrigerator leaked badly. The windows are single paned and very cheap. The door and deadbolt provide the security of a run down motel. I called the office and left messages for maintenance but no one ever came out to fix any of the issues. When I went to the office to ask to have maintenance come to my unit the manager said that new owners were in the process of buying the building and the tanglewood staff would be changing so I would have to wait for the staff change in order to have maintenance scheduled. After the new management (Pacific Shore Management) bought the building I requested maintenance and was told that all maintenance requests would have to be scheduled through the online system and the system was not set up for use at that time. So again, I waited. The office went through Xotchtil, Gabbie, Arianna and Margierite as office managers during which time the laundry room and pool were closed so even though I was required to purchase a laundry card, I was often unable to use the laundry facility. (The laundry cards must be bought for $5 and the credits must be purchased in the office...so if you work between 8-5 M-F, good luck getting laundry money on your card. Also the office is closed on weekends and holidays). Amazingly, I never got maintenance to come out. I was counting the days until my lease was up. A month before my lease was up I received a notice on my door informing me that the tent would be raised to$1275.00 if I chose to go to a month to month lease or $1175.00 should I choose to sign up for another year of living in that hell hole. I went ahead and gave my notice and scheduled my final inspection. Before the inspection with yet another office manager named Maribell, I scrubbed walls, doors, windows, baseboards, etc until the apartment was ready for immediate occupancy by a new tenant. Maribell was very polite and impressed and said the deductions to my deposit would be minimal, just the required carpet cleaning and a bit of touch up paint. She asked me to sign the final inspection sheet to which she said she would be marking everything as C for clean. Enormous mistake only part not getting that in writing. Out of $700 deposit....I received $207.00 back. A few other things you should know before making the move to Tanglewood: Utilities (water, trash, sewer) are all paid by the tenant. The bill for washer/ dryer/ pool bill/ sprinklers are all added up and divided amongst the renters, so when they say the rent is $1175.00-$1275.00, expect to pay another $75 monthly for utilities. There is no central heating and air it's just wall units. Freezing cold in the winter and unbearable in the summer months. Also, I have children myself so I am not opposed to children playing...but unsupervised children running around outside laughing and screaming at all hours of the night becomes extremely grating when the windows and walls do absolutely nothing for keeping out the noise. If you are considering a move to the Tanglewood Apartments in Escondido, I would strongly advise you to JUST KEEP LOOKING.","CROOKED.

1289991,"This complex is ridiculous, money hungry, and does not care about it's tenants. I wrote a positive review on this place earlier, that I now regret writing. Here's what you REALLY need to know.
First of all, the office has deals with both Bob's Towing, and Spectrum Utilities. NONE of the utilities are paid, and the gas and water are on a ""shared billing"" system, to drive the cost up for tenant, and keep it completely free for the office. You are not billed for your individual gas and water usage, instead the usage is calculated for the entire building, and divided evenly amongst each tenant. So, you can be very conservative with your gas and water usage, and you are still guaranteed a $200 Spectrum bill every month, and that doesn't even include your electric. I've experimented with this, and used absolutely no gas at all during a billing period, and was still charged for gas usage. Then called Spectrum, and they confirmed that the billing is split amongst the entire building, so do not let the office tell you otherwise.
On top of that, they send tow trucks to circle the parking lot EVERY DAY. They issue parking stickers, to prove that you live here, but you will get towed even if you have one. If you aren't parked at a perfect 90 degrees, you're towed. If you're tire is touching a line, you're towed. If you have to park in front of a building that isn't the one you live in, you're towed. If you are a couple inches too close to the sidewalk, you're towed. If you have nothing to do in a day, and you're car is parked for more than 24 hours, you're towed. And they do have visitor parking areas, but there are no signs to let you know where they are. So, if you have friends over, they're towed. So, it's easy to see that they have a deal with the towing company to split the pot on every car towed. There are at least 5 or 6 cars towed out of the place every day.
I also had a personnel experience with it once. I had a friend drive me to work, and when he dropped me off at home, which was at 10PM, there was a wrecker with a car already on it, in the lot in front of my building. When he stopped to let me out, and after only being stopped for about 10 seconds, the wrecker pulled in front of him, blocking him in. Two towing guys, and two apartment maintenance guys surrounded his car, shining flashlights in our faces. I got out and asked what this was about. And I was greeted with ""Another wrecker is on the way to tow this piece of **** of my lot."" I explained that I live here, and he just dropping me off from work. The maintenance guy got in my face and threatened to have me fined, and evicted, and that he was calling the cops. At that point, I pull out my phone, and dial the Florence Police. I put it on speaker to let them know I was really talking to the police department. Once they realized an office was on the way, the wrecker sped away, and my friend was able to leave. So, I suspect something they are doing might be illegal.
Plain and simple, if you like to pay $200 a day to park your car, and pay out the nose for utilities that the complex should be paying for, this is the place for you. Otherwise, if you have the least bit of intelligence you would avoid this place like the plague.","This complex is ridiculous&#44; money hungry&#44; and does not care about it&#39;s tenants.

Not even during the week rent is due. She talks about everyones business to all the tenants. She was even gone for like a week with no notice and came back with a huge ass so im guessing she got implants. 
The walls are so thin. You can hear everything in the other apartments and that also makes it so neighbors are constantly making noise complaints about everything. Noise curfew is at 10 which is too early being downtown. Any noise after 10 and you'll definitely get a complaint. 
Also one of the worse problems is that the fire alarm goes of soooooo much. Its horrible. Nobody leaves cause it happens so much. Its super loud high pitched and youll immediately have a headache. Sometimes its goes for a long time and sometimes it gets turned off almost immediately.  Theres never a fire but it goes off still. It went off 3 times in 1 week and 4 times in one day once. I feel like one day itss gonna be real and everybody is gonna burn up. Apartments are 2nd floor and up so everyone has to go down the stairs and theres no lights so you have to use ur cell phone or prop door open so u can see.

The 1 elevator(that is always dirty) breaks down all the time too. So much that a handicap guy had to move cause he'd be stuck for hours or days until its fixed. It was down for 3 days once and i felt so bad for him. 
The garage doors break all the time too. Which means they leave the broken one open for anyone to come in or down and make a path for ppl to get in through the one. 
Theres been 2 times when someone went on a crime spree in the garage. Mutiple cars broken into. Windows shattered. 
Homeless ppl sleep at the back door too and they shit(poop) right next to it and theres swarms of flies. It revolting.
People also smoke cigarettes in the garage and it feels like you are trapped in a bubble of smoke. The garbage area has roaches and it reaks. They dont empty them enough so if it gets really full then the hallways start to stink cause it goes up the trash chute. 
Theres so many problems here. Its definitely not luxury and its not worth the crazy amount of money they charge for this shit.

I dnt think she tells him like she is supposed too. Oh and to top it off im pretty sure a drug dealer lives in the building. I actually witnessed him selling in the hallway. I heard around the building that he sells coke and a lot of ppl know and even buy from him but he is good friends with the property manager so nothing is done about it. He also looks really creepy. Hes a white guy covered in tats looking like a wannabe gangster. I walked by his apartment on my way to the stairs and heard him beating his gf too. It was horrible. I had to hide when they came running out of the apartment.",602,0.0185728250244379,0.0,True

112061348,"A very affordable as well as a great place to live. One of the best value places you can find in town for price, size, location convenience, and upkeep. 
A little strict on a few key rules, as are mentioned in other comments, but if you understand they're in place to protect everyone then it's not something that should be a problem. 
The rules they're especially strict on are only you get to park in your designated parking spot, and no smoking in the apartments or anywhere on the property. Otherwise just be a good neighbor to the complex, pay your electricity bill, and everything is easy. The parking rule is a slight inconvenience if you'd like your visiting relative/friend to be able to park closer, but with all the drug/transient/homeless issue happening in Bellingham it's clear the rule is there for a reason and for everyone's safety. If you can handle that then you'll really enjoy the pros of living in this apt complex. 
Besides that, Sehome Ct is one of the nicest kept apartment complexes I have lived in. Quiet, clean, private, and the maintinance guy, Jeff, is great. For the most part he is the only person you will deal with in the complex, and occasionally the owner Dave when he comes around for routine city inspections announced ahead of time. When something breaks, it's fixed right away.  My kitchen sink was leaking slightly New Year's Eve, I left a message about it that night and it was fixed before the following evening New Year's Day when I got back, even with it being a holiday. The whole sink even was replaced to update the appliance. Also worth mentioning, as an early 30's single gal who lived alone, and I felt very comfortable and safe, at all hours, when I would come home late from work, which was a really big pro. The only reason I moved was my fiancé and I were starting a family together and I left to move in with him. 
Overall this was a great place to live  and I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants an affordable convenient and reliable apartment.","A very affordable as well as a great place to live. One of the best value places you can find in town for price, size, location convenience, and upkeep.

Late April I started to notice several apartments being exterminated by pest control. Due to this I began to inspect my beds, bedding and furniture. As I suspected there was evidence of bed bugs in my bedding, because I had not experience this issue in the 20 years I have been renting, I threw my queen size beds in the trash. 

I contacted front office staff to report there was an issue. May 5th, 2016 the exterminators came without notification, because I had all my items packed in plastic bags, the unit was ready. The exterminators did a dust treatment, and never returned. I was not aware the actual process required them to return three times, and assumed the bugs were gone. I still did not spend alot of time in the living area, for the fear of bed bugs.

When this issues was discussed this month Tiara stated the exterminator returned May 17th, but no one was home, this was not true. I later  was informed a 48hr noticed should have been placed on the door, and the exterminator would enter whether someone was home or not.

Since May 5th, bed bugs has greatly affected my living environment.

1: I do not sit in the living area, I am isolated in my room, which has no bed due to bed bugs.
2: I do not invite guest, nor visit others for fear of transporting bed bugs.
3: I wear light colored long sleeves, long pants and socks, the entire time I am home, which required  extra use of air conditioning.
4: I have spent over $100 in washing already clean items, $60 in rubbing alcohol, bug spray to kill bugs.
5: I am an administrator at my job, which requires me to wear formal clothing. Each day I have to dig in plastic bags to get dressed.
6: I am constantly paranoid there may be something crawling on my that someone else sees before I.
7: I have not watched television in over two months, because I am isolated to the room. 

It is very depressing to live in these conditions. I would also like to advise you I have a medical condition called Portal Vein Thrombosis, which is a serious blood clotting disorder. This disease cause severe pain, and having no bed, and being unable to become comfortable in an environment I am paying for exacerbates my symptoms.

June 22, I observed several bed bugs in the couch. I left a message with the front office. I did not receive a call back, so I called June 30th to inquire. At which time I was told I was being put on the extermination list for July 5th. I wonder if I did not call would I have been notified. I was then told I would need two more treatments, over a 4 week period.

My plan up until this point was to move out the apartments August 1st, but my options would have been to dispose of all my living room furniture, which would have been a big cost, as I already need to replace two queen size beds, and still possibly transport bed bugs in other items. I contemplated over and over about what to do, and felt it unfair to potentially infest a new place. For example in my current situation would you recommend I move to one of your other properties such as Aspen, Court Yard. I would hope not. As a result I have wasted money in application fees, to find out I am trapped due to bed bugs.

Now I have to renew my lease, which will cost me.","Center Park Apartment Corporate:
