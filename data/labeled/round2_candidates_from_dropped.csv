1247980,940565811676209,"Needless to say&#44; this was my first apartment ever in my life&#44; I was 21 going on 22&#44; and it was an interesting stay&#44; lemme just say that. I don&#39;t look back in anger&#44; I just look back at college and all the fun times:) had friends over and we just had fun. But ya&#44; I&#39;m not mad. It was like 3 years ago. But I&#39;ll be honest about what I experienced during the year I was there.

I have mixed reviews about this place. I mean it&#39;s old&#44; and I was in college so literally I found the cheapest closest thing available and usually rent on the first or second place I look at. I didn&#39;t really realize how low end it was till I lived in an affluent neighborhood later on and realized what an apartment really should be like.

Pros:

The staff&#44; Melissa especially&#44; are super super nice and always listen and try to help out. The maintainance is quick and helpful within their capabilities.
Rent is cheap&#44; at least when I was there. In 08-09 school year&#44; the smallest one bedroom was $525. Great deal&#44; and it was better than living in the crummy dorms I was in. According to the new management that came in in 2008&#44; all the carpet was replaced and they did do a pretty good job of fixing what was a &#34;fixer upper&#34; kind of complex that they had purchased. I do admit they really are working away at trying to renovate this place. But I was lucky enough to be there when they were redoing the roof.. during finals&#44; on the top floor. NOT cool man. 
They have Verizon FIOS which I absolutely loved&#44; Time Warner even at my apartments now that are nicer&#44; are such a pain. Verizon FIOS is the way to go if that&#39;s important to you.
In general&#44; I really do believe that they bought this place and are trying to work with what they have.

Cons:

The building is just old. They will show you a model that&#39;s renovated&#44; the renovations IMO are not worth the extra $100/month they want for it. And I was VERY surprised when I actually got to the apartment&#44; it looked NOTHING like the model. 

Here&#39;s a breakdown of how it differs from the model. The appliances are in every essence of the word: &#34;Dated&#34;. The flooring in the bathroom and kitchen&#44; though hard wood&#44; was very cheap and old. They did replace the carpet and it was spotless&#44; fluffy and clean when I moved in in July 2008. The pool is in an akward place&#44; although they renovated it and it&#39;s pretty&#44; it&#39;s just right in front of the office&#44; and only open around business hours. I never used it because I just don&#39;t like being watched out there. And I was in the office signing my lease and there were people in the pool I just didn&#39;t want to see.

My first month moving in&#44; my first electric bill ever was a shocker. It was late July early August.. so yeah it&#39;s gonna be high&#44; but it was over $200&#44; for a 625 sq ft apartment. Yes on the third floor&#44; but still&#44; I paid all that and it never even got under 80 degrees that whole month. Ask maintenance they tried to replace a filter or something on it to see if it would help&#44; but it just didn&#39;t. It&#39;s just an old building. i wasn&#39;t there in winter&#44; I spent most of my time with my mom during the holiday&#44; so I don&#39;t know how the heating bill would&#39;ve been.

Randomly one evening&#44; I was sitting on the couch and the stove arced and scared the bejeesus outta me. Once again&#44; bless the sweet maintenance people&#44; they just fixed it by bending the groun back toward the stove. I was scared to go near it for a couple days.

The bedroom are roomy&#44; but I wish some of the space would&#39;ve been alocated to the living room/dining which was pretty small in my &#34;smallest&#34; apartment in the complex. 

The bathroom was tight too. Seemed fine until I moved to another place and compaired. It is cramped.

Another point I want to make&#44; Melissa&#44; though as sweet as she is&#44; kept remarking in the model apartment how&#44; oh that bathtub needs to be resurfaced&#44; oh this and oh that. But I got to my apartment (after she wouldn&#39;t let me see it until move in day cause it wasn&#39;t &#34;clean&#34; or &#34;ready to be shown&#34;) and the tiles on the bathtub wall looked like someone sledge hammered it and they put mismatched (offwhite) tiles in with a really bad job of the grout. Again&#44; it was my first place&#44; and cheap so I just ignored it.

The first month I moved in I had an infestation of carpenter ants... ALL over my living room wall. They just creeped further and further. Me being the dumb 21 year old I was just sprayed Febreeze on them to kill them. Then they made a little ant hill&#44; (on the 2nd floor mind you)&#44; in the groove where my sliding patio door is. Maintanence cleared them up&#44; as they always do. I swear they fixed everything in this place&#44; but I give them that&#44; that they ARE dependable. And the maintenance manager lived below me so I guess maybe it was convenient to take care of the apartment closest to him lol

The patio is not really something I sat on much&#44; for one there was a broken sprinkler outside my apartment that basically went off like &#34;Old Faithful&#34; each and EVERY night without fail at 10pm. I always thought it was raining cause it would hit my bedroom window lol If I was outside on the patio&#44; I would get sprayed on. There were wasps when I first moved in&#44; so I just rushed in side every time I came home. I called Melissa&#44; and she said they couldn&#39;t do anything about it unless it was a hive. I got a little mad at her&#44; and just went along with it. Eh.

I worked nights Thursday through Sunday and went to school Monday through Friday. I would get my lovely Saturday and Sunday to sleep in&#44; and come home late Th-Sunday nights. Two cons here&#44; big big cons. Every frikkin Saturday morning&#44; there were Hispanics having soccer games at the fields next door. And all I&#39;d here is bomp bomp bomp bomp-bomp-bomp bomp bomp.. And it was frikkin loud. I don&#39;t have anything against other nationalities&#44; I just can&#39;t stand loud base on a Saturday morning. It&#39;s nerveracking after getting home at 11-12 midnight the night before and having school all day before that. I just want REST before I go back to work. And at night&#44; I lived in a corner&#44; in the back&#44; facing the woods (another cute little side story I&#39;ll get to in a minute).. parking was rediculous. I&#39;d have to walk like 3 buildings down to get parking. If I arrived during the day I usually had very convenient parking right up front. But after 9-10 pm on a weekend&#44; just forget it. And there was someone that had a jeap or small truck or something and I swear it was parked there for 8 out of the 13 months I was there and no one did anything. We just parked in handicap cause no one used those spots. The worst was when I had to park up at the mailbox next to the high way&#44; and had to walk the entire apartment complex to go home. Talk about annoying. 

The laundry facilities&#44; I never used&#44; but tried once. Never again. They&#39;re hot&#44; no a/c .. doors open and expensive. Lots of people to wait on so no going back to the house to wait. I just took clothes to my mom.

My neighbors on one side were frikkin noisy. We have inside carpeted stairs in 2nd floor apartments and it sounded like they were riding trash can lids down the stairs and wrestling. Beating on the walls/calling the office didn&#39;t help there.

When my downstairs neighbor moved out&#44; they left trash outside and the racoons got into it and it took managment like 4 days to get to it&#44; and it was disgusting to deal with.. and I sure wasn&#39;t touching it not knowing what the heck was in it.

The grounds are desolate&#44; very little grass etc. They are trying pretty hard to clean the place up&#44; it was probably a dump when they bought it. Just don&#39;t let the pretty office fool you. It&#39;s average or right below average for your typical college student apartment.

Even with all that went on&#44; I felt very safe. Never had anything stolen or broken into&#44; even with the vagrants and weird people I lived around.

The side story I was gonna get at.. every night I had a little frog I called Pete&#44; he would be waiting for me on my door step just about every night I came home from work since I lived facing the ravine/woods/creek thing. I saw skunks and possums and all kinds of stuff. I actually thought that was cute :P

And I lived in the smallest official 1 bed 1 bath.. not the efficiency.

Really an apartment is what you make of it&#44; I was a college student and it worked for me&#44; with the frustrations&#44; I&#39;d say I think a year was enough lol. Now with a degree and a better job I can move on to higher ground :)",1,False

112311042,9199332346275145227,"There were 4 of us that lived there for a year. We kept our apartment spotless. We paid our rent on time and had no issues the year we lived there. We went through the apartment checkout inspection and Janeen walked the apartment. She told us that our apartment was clean but that their policy is that it must be spotless. She saidwe were going to have to pay to have the apartment deep cleaned, painted and maybe have the carpets replaced. We told her that did not make any sense because we had the apartment cleaned. We did understand there were a few nail holes and so she said they would have to paint the entire room to cover the holes. But the clicher was when she said because there were areas in the carpet that showed where we had walked me may have to replace the carpet. We told her the law says normal wear and tear is permitted. She even told us that our apartment was the cleanest one she had seen in days and that she appreciated all of the work we had put into it. Now, a week later we are being charged our entire deposit plus almost $600 to replace the carpet. We have been told by an attorney that they have to prove that it is beyond normal wear and tear and that we destroyed or neglected the carpet but in the mean time they are going to turn us all over to a collection agency. I can&apos;t wait to see how this plays out in small claims court because what they are doing is illegal. Be sure to take pictures of the place when you move in and when you move out.

I love how there is nature on one side of the place and the village on the other. Its so nice going to the Victor events and being able to walk home. My kids even love the schools and have lots of friends who live here or around the corner.
we will be here for quite sometime unless employees change and it becomes run down&#44; but both offices are pretty strict with the rules and make life so much easier for everyone because it is consistent and everyone knows what to expect.

I am listing Cons first because they are much more important to me. Manager is an arrogant man who speaks down to every resident I have met. The lease is very demanding&#44; understandably so&#44; and has very high expectations when you move out. I hired a cleaning service on my own dime so that I would get my security deposit back. I was still charged cleaning fees even though the place was spotless. I was warned by another tenant I spoke with as he was moving out&#44; and ended up experiencing the same thing as he did.
Management allows pets with some restrictions on breed. Before adopting a dog&#44; I made the mistake of filling our the pet application. It was denied on grounds of breed restrictions. Additionally&#44; dogs were supposed to be leashed and kept in the back yard only. After adopting a dog and handing in my pet deposit&#44; I was nearly attacked in the parking lot not 1 but 2 times by an unleashed Doberman Pinscher&#44; which is a breed supposedly on the &#34;restricted&#34; list. After complaining 3 times&#44; I was told that the animal was a &#34;special case&#34;.

112295840,561368844433432,"I moved into this condominium on June 11, 2018 and rented from owner Gerald and Donna Kramer. I rented apartment 2 G. The apartment is located on the second floor facing West at the front of the building. At the time I rented the apartment, there was a family living there with a lot of furniture, and I was unable to do a thorough inspection. My experience: From day one I had nothing but problems. I submitted my application on May 10, 2018 for the rental at $1600 per month to a property management company in Delray beach along with a $100 check for the application, a $125 check for the elevator usage, and gave a $1600 deposit to the real estate agent Mike K. from Keller Williams. My lease for apartment two G was supposed to begin on June 8, 2018. This is when all the problems began. The property management company told me they approved my lease within a 48 hour period and it was up to the condo association at Boca View to bring me in for an interview. I called the president of the condo association Diana repetitively trying to schedule an interview, and after I identified myself on the phone to her, she claimed she could not hear me and would hang up the phone. This happened three times on three separate dates. I contacted the landlord Gerald Kramer who connected with the condo association president Diana who got me in for an interview with herself three days prior to my lease beginning. Their delay in approving me as a tenant within a timely manner caused me to have to pack a three bedroom house and hire a mover on short notice paying double the amount it should have cost me, causing tons of unnecessary aggravation for myself and my family and everyone else involved. The whole approval process was handled completely unprofessionally. This should have been my first sign to back out of the lease. Upon moving into apartment 2 G, I was provided with one key for the entrance to the building. I have a family of three and we are all listed on the lease. Even though it was specified in my lease that I needed three keys, the landlords Gerald and Donna Kramer attempted to gain an additional $75 deposit which was not agreed to. The landlord claimed he did not have the keys and I needed to get it them from Diana, the condo association president. Diana on the other hand claimed I needed to get the additional keys for my family from the landlord. The lack of communication between the owners and the property management is inexcusable. My last name was never added to the intercom at the front door to buzz guests in, despite numerous times asking both the landlord and Diana. Within a few days of my tenancy, we noticed a putrid smell coming from the guest bathroom. Although we cleaned the bathroom thoroughly we could not understand where the stench was coming from. During the first week of our stay we had nothing but problems. Apartment Two G had an infestation of roaches and sugar ants. Although the landlord did send a handyman in who sprayed Raid Bug Spray in the apartment, the roaches continued the to thrive. The first week in the apartment the master bathtub stuffed up, the master bathroom toilet bowl would not flush and the guest bathroom toilet bowl would not flush without holding the handle down. The spinner at the bottom of the dishwasher continuously banged every time you ran a cycle. There is construction going on at the Camino Real bridge. At the time I signed the lease I was told the construction was all underground and I would not hear noise. Apartment 2 G faces the front of the building , and it literally sounded like a war zone being in that apartment every day. The amount of noise was as if we were sitting in the middle of the construction site. This went on Monday through Saturday. After about one week of being there, realizing the apartment had an infestation of bugs, an odor of feces, and numerous other problems, I contacted an attorney to get me out of the lease. The landlords agreed to mutually terminate the lease. At this point I began emptying out cabinets including the kitchen and the guest bathroom. Upon emptying out the cabinets I found black mold growing up the walls behind the cabinet drawers. Please see the attached photos. Both of the bathrooms have pipe leaks which was causing the mold to grow. I reported this to the Code Enforcement department in Boca Raton and spoke directly with Dennis Spellman. There is a report on file. The mold was reported to the health department. The master bedroom walls are extremely thin and I could hear the person snoring in the next apartment. Additionally, the walls in the bathroom are also very thin and I could hear children taking baths coming from above on a nightly basis. The apartment was rented out with water and cable included. I was never informed that the building has a contract with DIRECTV, and they require all the tenants and owners to purchase the cable boxes at a cost between $100 and $200 per box. I Spoke with DIRECTV, and I was told that this is an arrangement that was put in force by the condo association. You are not allowed to rent the cable boxes, you must purchase them. As far as the building in general is concerned, here are my thoughts. Boca View is located about two blocks from the beach. The location is ideal and it&apos;s a beautiful street. The building itself is very old. There are air fresheners in the majority of outlets on every floor that let out a very perfumey type of smell. In my opinion, the air fresheners are used to hide the smell of must. There are cameras everywhere in the building, but I did not see this as a problem. The sauna in the building is gross as is the shower that is adjacent to the sauna. The pool area is mediocre and sits on top of the garage with zero shade and zero atmosphere. There are washers and dryer&apos;s on each floor, three washers and three dryers. It is a genuine pain in the butt to have to bring all your laundry down hallways and sit around and wait for everything to be completed so the next person can use it. Also I did not feel the dryers dried clothes efficiently and each cycle required excess usage. The noise from the construction is absolutely horrendous and will be going on for approximately 18 months. In addition to the constant loud noise, in order to get to a grocery store one must now drive to Hillsboro or Palmetto because the Camino Real bridge is shut down. The only positive to living in this building that I could see was the location to the beach, and the $1600 a month rent. But be warned, you do get what you pay for. I spoke to numerous tenants and homeowners in the building, and from what I learned, the majority of the reviews that I have read are all true. There is a ton of dissatisfaction and unpleasantries within the building experienced by everybody I encountered. I would absolutely not recommend this building to anybody, and I thank gosh my attorney was able to get me out of this lease and I only experienced two weeks of this hell. It is unfathomable to me that it is legal to rent out an apartment with mold. Yes, it is legal. There should be full disclosure just as if somebody was purchasing a home. Living in this home for two weeks exposed myself and my young children to black mold which could have seriously jeopardized our health. I thank gosh that I caught onto the problems experienced within this apartment at the very beginning of the lease, and I am extremely grateful to be out. The landlords did agreed to refund all my money minus the prorated amount for the rent of two weeks that I spent there. The day that I was to meet their assistant to return my keys, The landlord Gerald Kramer tried to back out of our legal agreement, and was trying to deduct $1600 from the amount of money he owed me, and claimed he was at a loss for the realtors commission therefore I should be penalized. Thankfully I had a legal agreement in writing with all signatures, so he ended up paying me what was owed to me. This is my warning to anybody considering apartment Two G. I would run like hell in the opposite direction. Please take a look at the photos attached. These were all taken with in the apartment. Completely disgusting. Look at the amount of mold that was hidden behind cabinets. I can only imagine what was behind the walls.",1,False
112295840,561368844433432,"I moved into this condominium on June 11, 2018 and rented from owner Gerald and Donna Kramer. I rented apartment 2 G. The apartment is located on the second floor facing West at the front of the building. At the time I rented the apartment, there was a family living there with a lot of furniture, and I was unable to do a thorough inspection. My experience: From day one I had nothing but problems. I submitted my application on May 10, 2018 for the rental at $1600 per month to a property management company in Delray beach along with a $100 check for the application, a $125 check for the elevator usage, and gave a $1600 deposit to the real estate agent Mike K. from Keller Williams. My lease for apartment two G was supposed to begin on June 8, 2018. This is when all the problems began. The property management company told me they approved my lease within a 48 hour period and it was up to the condo association at Boca View to bring me in for an interview. I called the president of the condo association Diana repetitively trying to schedule an interview, and after I identified myself on the phone to her, she claimed she could not hear me and would hang up the phone. This happened three times on three separate dates. I contacted the landlord Gerald Kramer who connected with the condo association president Diana who got me in for an interview with herself three days prior to my lease beginning. Their delay in approving me as a tenant within a timely manner caused me to have to pack a three bedroom house and hire a mover on short notice paying double the amount it should have cost me, causing tons of unnecessary aggravation for myself and my family and everyone else involved. The whole approval process was handled completely unprofessionally. This should have been my first sign to back out of the lease. Upon moving into apartment 2 G, I was provided with one key for the entrance to the building. I have a family of three and we are all listed on the lease. Even though it was specified in my lease that I needed three keys, the landlords Gerald and Donna Kramer attempted to gain an additional $75 deposit which was not agreed to. The landlord claimed he did not have the keys and I needed to get it them from Diana, the condo association president. Diana on the other hand claimed I needed to get the additional keys for my family from the landlord. The lack of communication between the owners and the property management is inexcusable. My last name was never added to the intercom at the front door to buzz guests in, despite numerous times asking both the landlord and Diana. Within a few days of my tenancy, we noticed a putrid smell coming from the guest bathroom. Although we cleaned the bathroom thoroughly we could not understand where the stench was coming from. During the first week of our stay we had nothing but problems. Apartment Two G had an infestation of roaches and sugar ants. Although the landlord did send a handyman in who sprayed Raid Bug Spray in the apartment, the roaches continued the to thrive. The first week in the apartment the master bathtub stuffed up, the master bathroom toilet bowl would not flush and the guest bathroom toilet bowl would not flush without holding the handle down.

Even though it was specified in my lease that I needed three keys, the landlords Gerald and Donna Kramer attempted to gain an additional $75 deposit which was not agreed to. The landlord claimed he did not have the keys and I needed to get it them from Diana, the condo association president. Diana on the other hand claimed I needed to get the additional keys for my family from the landlord. The lack of communication between the owners and the property management is inexcusable. My last name was never added to the intercom at the front door to buzz guests in, despite numerous times asking both the landlord and Diana. Within a few days of my tenancy, we noticed a putrid smell coming from the guest bathroom. Although we cleaned the bathroom thoroughly we could not understand where the stench was coming from. During the first week of our stay we had nothing but problems. Apartment Two G had an infestation of roaches and sugar ants. Although the landlord did send a handyman in who sprayed Raid Bug Spray in the apartment, the roaches continued the to thrive. The first week in the apartment the master bathtub stuffed up, the master bathroom toilet bowl would not flush and the guest bathroom toilet bowl would not flush without holding the handle down. The spinner at the bottom of the dishwasher continuously banged every time you ran a cycle. There is construction going on at the Camino Real bridge. At the time I signed the lease I was told the construction was all underground and I would not hear noise. Apartment 2 G faces the front of the building , and it literally sounded like a war zone being in that apartment every day. The amount of noise was as if we were sitting in the middle of the construction site. This went on Monday through Saturday. After about one week of being there, realizing the apartment had an infestation of bugs, an odor of feces, and numerous other problems, I contacted an attorney to get me out of the lease. The landlords agreed to mutually terminate the lease. At this point I began emptying out cabinets including the kitchen and the guest bathroom. Upon emptying out the cabinets I found black mold growing up the walls behind the cabinet drawers. Please see the attached photos. Both of the bathrooms have pipe leaks which was causing the mold to grow. I reported this to the Code Enforcement department in Boca Raton and spoke directly with Dennis Spellman. There is a report on file. The mold was reported to the health department. The master bedroom walls are extremely thin and I could hear the person snoring in the next apartment. Additionally, the walls in the bathroom are also very thin and I could hear children taking baths coming from above on a nightly basis. The apartment was rented out with water and cable included. I was never informed that the building has a contract with DIRECTV, and they require all the tenants and owners to purchase the cable boxes at a cost between $100 and $200 per box. I Spoke with DIRECTV, and I was told that this is an arrangement that was put in force by the condo association. You are not allowed to rent the cable boxes, you must purchase them. As far as the building in general is concerned, here are my thoughts. Boca View is located about two blocks from the beach. The location is ideal and it&apos;s a beautiful street. The building itself is very old. There are air fresheners in the majority of outlets on every floor that let out a very perfumey type of smell. In my opinion, the air fresheners are used to hide the smell of must. There are cameras everywhere in the building, but I did not see this as a problem. The sauna in the building is gross as is the shower that is adjacent to the sauna. The pool area is mediocre and sits on top of the garage with zero shade and zero atmosphere. There are washers and dryer&apos;s on each floor, three washers and three dryers. It is a genuine pain in the butt to have to bring all your laundry down hallways and sit around and wait for everything to be completed so the next person can use it. Also I did not feel the dryers dried clothes efficiently and each cycle required excess usage. The noise from the construction is absolutely horrendous and will be going on for approximately 18 months. In addition to the constant loud noise, in order to get to a grocery store one must now drive to Hillsboro or Palmetto because the Camino Real bridge is shut down. The only positive to living in this building that I could see was the location to the beach, and the $1600 a month rent. But be warned, you do get what you pay for. I spoke to numerous tenants and homeowners in the building, and from what I learned, the majority of the reviews that I have read are all true. There is a ton of dissatisfaction and unpleasantries within the building experienced by everybody I encountered. I would absolutely not recommend this building to anybody, and I thank gosh my attorney was able to get me out of this lease and I only experienced two weeks of this hell. It is unfathomable to me that it is legal to rent out an apartment with mold. Yes, it is legal. There should be full disclosure just as if somebody was purchasing a home. Living in this home for two weeks exposed myself and my young children to black mold which could have seriously jeopardized our health. I thank gosh that I caught onto the problems experienced within this apartment at the very beginning of the lease, and I am extremely grateful to be out. The landlords did agreed to refund all my money minus the prorated amount for the rent of two weeks that I spent there. The day that I was to meet their assistant to return my keys, The landlord Gerald Kramer tried to back out of our legal agreement, and was trying to deduct $1600 from the amount of money he owed me, and claimed he was at a loss for the realtors commission therefore I should be penalized. Thankfully I had a legal agreement in writing with all signatures, so he ended up paying me what was owed to me. This is my warning to anybody considering apartment Two G. I would run like hell in the opposite direction. Please take a look at the photos attached. These were all taken with in the apartment. Completely disgusting. Look at the amount of mold that was hidden behind cabinets. I can only imagine what was behind the walls.",1,False

112312783,9199332346275176182,"I will start with the positives of living here for a few short weeks. Working with Evan in the office has been wonderful. He has answered all questions with confidence and kindness. We also appreciate the package delivery system in which we are notified via text and email alerts- that is something neither my roommate nor myself have had at other complexes and it is very convenient and appreciated. All members of the maintenance crew have been very kind and quick to resolve issues submitted to the best of their abilities. The inside of the apartment is beautiful for the most part, but the layout of the kitchen is odd. The wine cabinet above the fridge is a complete waste of space as we do not drink at all. The car cleaning station is a nice amenity. The pool is beautiful. The dog park is also lovely. However, the pest control has yet to be resolved. We find 5+ new bugs in the apartment everyday. I know the pest control guy is trying his best, but I hope we can find an ultimate solution soon. So disgusting to find new bugs everyday in such a beautiful and new home. I understand that this is a new development and  we are close to an undeveloped open field, but surely there can be more done to keep the pests out. 

Additional negatives to living here:
There is a back gate fence between our community and open field construction grounds. There is a rock that props the door open at all times, directly behind building 14. This seems like a security and safety issue. 
- the upstairs neighbors are very noisy, stomping around and making other loud noises after 10 PM on weekdays and weeknights, however as I will mention below, we do not feel comfortable addressing this with them as we fear they are aggressive and intolerant to civil and open communication,  or even addressing it with office staff, unfortunately. Its a very uncomfortable situation that could have been handled way better. 
-The aggressive tone in emails sent from management about nitpicky things in the community are ridiculous. 
-Jason is always nervous and awkward when approached, and though he means well and is a nice person, we avoid going into the office with questions when he or Taylor are present as they both make us feel very uncomfortable. (sidenote: There is a female agent who lives on site, not sure what her name is, but she has always been kind and courteous. Evan is also very helpful and kind)
-We have both lived in far less luxurious apartments before this, but have had valet trash services before- an absolute must-have amenity. We sacrificed that amenity when choosing to live here because of a lot of other great things we liked about the complex. But after living here a few weeks, it is truly a shame that Cortland Partners does not offer that service when everything else seems to be at a high luxury standard. Obviously we are capable of walking our trash to the dumpster ourselves, but it is a suggestion that valet trash, and even some sort of recycling options should be offered even for an additional fee. 

-A separate but relevant issue as well- I hope to never deal with Taylor De Leon ever again if possible. The only person who I have truly felt comfortable speaking with in person is Evan.  But unfortunately Taylor is the manager here and I dont know who to go to to resolve issues if they escalate to the nature of requiring a manager. Her leadership and communication skills are outrageous and unacceptable. She should not be in any managerial type position, and if this cannot be changed, she needs training on how to improve as someone in charge of customer service satisfaction. Horatio as Assistant Manager seems to be better at his job than Taylor is, so in the future we will go to him with the hope that he can help with patience and professionalism. 

To preface the number one issue and negative situation we have experienced so far, I must explain the background. I moved in on the evening of the 19th around 9 PM. We had AT&T come and come set up our cable and internet the afternoon of the 20th. As per my lease states, I have an 8 month old puppy with me. We moved from Florida which was a 15+ hour drive. This was a new apartment for both her and I. The first night here we did not have any bedroom furniture so we both slept in the living room on the couch. The maintenance closet door rattled very loudly every time the A/C unit turned on, which was several times at night through the morning. This issue has since been addressed (but not until a week after moving in), but I need to paint a very clear picture framing my current concerns. In addition to the noisy door, there were a lot of new sights and sounds that could be alarming to ANY animal. 

My puppy was startled by that loud rattle and barked a few times that night and a few times in the morning. She was calmed down quickly afterwards. She did not bark incessantly for more than 2 minutes. The next day, 2 strange men (the AT&T guys) came in to our apartment and spent several hours setting up our cable and internet (from 11 AM- 3 PM). As a puppy, she barked at these strange men until she became more comfortable with them. She did not bark the entire 4+ hours they were there non-stop, but more like intermittently here and there when they opened up new equipment and the like. The following night we had bedroom furniture and slept in the master bedroom, but the A/C door still rattled all night. My puppy did bark a few times throughout the night, but again, not hours at a time. I made sure to note all of her barking instances, and did my best to calm her down instantly. She was in daycare all day on the 21st, and we were not home for most of the day on the 22nd. When I did return home on the 22nd (Sunday evening), I took my puppy out to relieve herself as we are still house training in this new home. The upstairs neighbor proceeded to come out to her balcony and aggressively verbalize that the barking was unacceptable and that she had lived there for a year and never had any problems before we moved in, and she didnt want any now. She claimed that she tried to come talk to us in our apartment but we were not home. This was the first interaction with these neighbors in 14****, and it immediately felt like harassment, but I apologized profusely and explained the situation that we had just moved in and she was a puppy adjusting to her new surroundings, and we were doing everything to quiet her down. I went to bed that night EXTREMELY upset that we were spoken to that way, and immediately started researching online how to help my puppy adjust and to reduce any and all barking in additional ways than what I had already tried. I personally did all I could to contain the barking the rest of that night and the following morning, and felt that it was improving already. 

However, I feel that I must state the obvious in that this IS a dog friendly complex, and sometimes it is completely out of anyones control if my animal or any other animal in the complex is going to bark at something, as well as it is outrageous for anyone to expect it to be a non-barking environment. Animals are not humans, just so we are all clear. This is an apartment complex with so many types of families and animals, it is impossible for it to be completely silent at all times as our upstairs tenants wish it to be. I have also NEVER had anyone complain about me as a tenant, so this whole experience is extremely upsetting and disturbing to me, even 3 weeks later (as of 8/9/18). (sidenote: after talking to other dog owners in the community, I now realize there are some ridiculous people living here who should probably find land in the middle of nowhere and build a house there to truly be happy. )

The following Monday morning I received a voice mail from Taylor to call her back ASAP, which I did on my way to taking my puppy to daycare. The following is an honest re-cap of our conversation, from a brand new tenant and customers point of view. She started the conversation with a disclaimer: I am an animal lover, however... and proceeded to explain that several people had complained about the barking and it needed to be under control ASAP. When I tried to explain the whole move-in situation as I just did above, she was extremely dismissive and condescending. When I asked if anyone had complained as of that morning as I had significantly tried to stop the barking since the incident with the aggressive neighbor on the balcony hours before, she said it did not matter who or when any complaints were made, but that I needed to get it under control. When I explained that the neighbor was somewhat hostile the night before, she did not acknowledge it. She did not even try to listen or try understand my point of view and explained that if I had made the same or similar complaints, that I would want the same thing done for me; a manager reaching out to the neighbor to solve the complaint. But as someone who claims to love animals as Taylor said she does, she somehow does not understand how this could have possibly been a big transition for a small animal which would require an adjustment period more than THREE days worth.  She truly was one-sided and appeared to be biased, as if she is long-time friends and allies with the upstairs tenants. As new tenants, our perspectives and situations were irrelevant. She did not once try to welcome me to the community during the call, even though this was my very first interaction with her. When I asked how I could email her in the future if I had similar issues or complaints, she dismissed the question and said that anyone in the office could help me, and she also refused to give me her email address and said that it was too long and complicated to give me. When I told her I was frustrated in working with Jason and would appreciate to work with her or someone else in the future, she questioned how I could possibly have any issues with Jason and instead of trusting that I was frustrated, she demanded I give her specific examples of what Jason did wrong. Again, she dismissed my concerns and did not try to provide me with alternative means of communication with different staff members. 

I have lived in apartments for a long time. I have had noisy upstairs neighbors before. But as a decent human being with basic people skills, I have patience and understanding to realize that moving in is a big process. I often put myself in others shoes. If I were the upstairs tenant and in their situation, I would not go and complain within THREE days of a new neighbor moving in. However, if the situation persisted for more than a few weeks, I would then try to say something to the tenant myself, and try to resolve it in a civil and kind manner before involving a manager. It was truly an unfortunate and unpleasant experience as a whole. We have since become friends with several of our surrounding neighbors, but avoid the upstairs tenants at all costs. To feel so harassed as brand new tenants ourselves is very disappointing. We have not felt welcomed by them or the office staff at all. If I had any interest in any additional communication with Taylor, despite her condescending nature, I would submit my own complaints stating that we have felt harassed and unwelcome as new tenants, which is a valid complaint in itself. However, we have yet to file any complaints at all, for fear of any negative retaliation or threats from neighbors or managers.

We now feel like prisoners in our own home, as if we are not allowed to make a peep, otherwise the police might be called or we will be threatened by Taylor again. That is very discouraging. We were truly so excited to move in to this neighborhood and community just a few weeks ago. We were even told multiple times by Jason before we moved in that Cortland Partners valued customer satisfaction and customer service. This is an odd predicament to be in after such high praises about customer service. Now we are disappointed to be here and feel like anything we do is under severe scrutiny. At this point in time, we would not recommend any of our friends or even strangers to live here in the future.",1,False

We are lowest of the low when it comes to protecting our rights. We have no smarts to take action. She also said we are all low-income people and have no money to take action. She feels that gives her the right to cheat us. Got news for her. There are many people living at Skyline that can or do make a good living. Some are not so fortunate&#44; but they have means to have action taken against AMC.
What we renters say means little&#44; but a company with large revenue can and will cover things up. I am sure they pay out to cover their nasty deeds. Some renters say that AMC pays off our Housing Authority to pass inspections. I have heard of this in other areas I have lived. Money changes hands all the time in large corporations. 
Customers can go to congressional s websites and find addresses and telephone numbers to contact them. I strongly suggest writing them and sending your letters to their addresses here in Colorado and send letters to their offices in Washington D.C. If you wish you can even hand carry your letter to their addresses here in Colorado. Make sure to make enough copies of your letter so that you have extra&#39;s for yourself and your attorney(s) if you choose to hire an attorney. If you are low- income&#44; you can find an attorney that may take your case as Pro Bono (no or low fees). Some attorneys enjoy Pro Bono cases as it keeps their skills intact. Anyway&#44; send your letters via registered mail so you get a receipt knowing that your congressional&#39;s received your letter. You can also fax your letters to your congressional&#39;s along with sending your letter via postal mail. Anyway&#44; you will get a response from your congressional&#39;s and they will tell you what the next step will be. It takes about a month to hear back from them. Congressional&#39;s have staff on board that help take care of your case and they are quick about responding. If you cannot afford an attorney then contacting your congressional&#39;s is your best bet. The congressional&#39;s are good at what they do.
AMC cannot pay off congressional&#39;s to cover their illegal activities. Congressional&#39;s don&#39;t go for money changing hands especially when numerous people such as us voted these them into office. Congressional&#39;s are not shady people and will not accept bribes. Our votes far outweigh what AMC can do to protect themselves. We as individuals outnumber AMC. Congressional&#39;s are there to help us and they do. Make sure you place every detail of your experiences at Skyline in your letter. Even send pictures if you have to. The more you tell the more will be done to help you.
Day in and day out&#44; I hear renters tell the disgusting things that the Skyline manger does. I hear of her putting people in tears and more. Is that called professionalism? I don t know what educational background this manager has&#44; but I am thinking she has no educational background because she is callus and unprofessional. I don t see how anyone can work for AMC. It s a discreditable company and I would be embarrassed to tell anyone that I work for AMC. The manager has made threats at times toward renters. It has to end and the only way to do that is having past and current renters begin to write their letter to congressional representatives. I had heard rumor that a previous tenant was having renters sign a petition for a class action lawsuit. I sure would like to find this person and sign their petition. Other renters have asked about this petition also and I told them I had heard about it to and that I am checking into it.
I just learned that AMC owns a utility company. So is their utility company the one that charges us exorbitant fees in our utility billing? A strong possibility. A renter from another AMC complex stated that AMC takes $30.00 from each and every utility bill sent out and pockets that $30.00. That is a large chuck of change they are taking from us. AMC goes to every extreme to make money. If I were they&#44; I would be ashamed to own a company where they are stealing from their customer/renters. Won&#39;t have many customers left if they continue to do what they do. Once that happens their business will become a distant memory. I am also looking into their other companies. AMC is a big monopoly. As I always say&#44; the larger the company the least caring they are about people that give them their bread and butter. They do not want to maintain their property and only buy more property to increase their profits. I also just learned the names of the owners of AMC and their other companies. Very interesting indeed. Maybe renters should contact the owners&#44; as they may not know what their employee&#39;s are doing to their customers. They could end up in shock. But as most say&#44; &#39;It all rolls downhill&#39;&#44; so they must know what is happening and they maybe the culprits. Maybe their employee&#39;s are taking the owners money and the owners are unaware it. Its been known to happen.
To the one who just recently left a positive review. I find the review a little suspicious. The way it is worded as if a Skyline employee wrote it. How are we to know if the review is genuine? If it is genuine then I would have to say that you have not resided at Skyline long enough to know what has happened and will continue to happen. I have lived here over a year now and seen many negative issues transpire.
Another important piece of information I find awful is the manager s slurring of racial epithets. At least 2 to 3 times per week I am in the office. I have heard the manager call people of all races nasty words of their race in this complex. She degrades Afro Americans&#44; Hispanics and other races. She surely will rent to people of all races to get their money. I find this upsetting for all renters. It shows we are only used and abused. My children come home hearing of things the manager says. My children do not understand why she does these things. They are confused. My daughter told me the manager has her favorites of certain children. This upsets her and she tells me the manager ignores her.
If past renters are reading this&#44; I suggest you not give up the fight. I do not mean to be patronizing&#44; but when you write a review what is it actually going to get you and others. In order for things to take effect&#44; a person has to take further action. Writing a review is helpful&#44; but it really does not get any of us anywhere. I hear so many complain&#44; move out&#44; and then nothing ever happens. No&#44; Skyline will be Skyline as long as we allow them to continue to do what they do. Moving out is fine&#44; but the troubles will not end unless we all do something. Someone suggested the renters have a town meeting located on neutral grounds meaning not have the meeting at Skyline. Meet in a coffee shop&#44; a park setting on a warm day and we can discuss what can be done. 
Lastly&#44; I think AMC needs to get this manager out of this complex. She has caused the majority of the trouble. AMC makes the majority of their money by moving people in and moving them out. They do not make much money when people remain here. They charge fees for this and for that when people move out or some moving in The manger gets a large bonus every time she rents a unit. Everything is a childish game to her and again&#44; she has no regard for human life. She gets a feeling of elation when she upsets people. Some day she may need help and no one will be there to help her after all the things she has done to people. I cannot say I do not blame them for turning their backs on her. I do feel badly for her&#44; she must have a sickness to do what she does. I hope she is getting help.",1,False

1494630,440582750044133,"When I first came to Spruce Run to inquire about an apartment&#44; Dawn was a joy to speak with. She was very friendly and personable and made me feel very welcome. She spoke very highly of the Spruce Run community and I immediately felt like this would be a nice place to call home.
With that being said&#44; I cannot say anything nice about the rest of the office staff. VERY POOR customer service!
I feel as though once I signed the lease&#44; there was no reason for the staff to be personable or care because I was locked into an agreement and there is nothing I can do. Every time that I do have to speak with the office staff I am made to feel very uncomfortable&#44; like I am inconveniencing them. There are no friendly greetings. I get a quick  Hi  and a look like  What do you want? . 

My first encounter was with a woman (I don t recall her name&#44; but she is a little heavy with long curly hair).  I had just used my dryer for the first time and I only had a medium load&#44; but I had to run it through the dryer 3 times for 50 minutes each to get everything dry. It should not take that long to dry clothes&#44; so I thought to inform them so that they could have maintenance check out the dryer in case anything was wrong with it. When I explained what happened to this woman&#44; instead of immediately saying that she would have maintenance check it out&#44; she just looked at me like I was stupid&#44; and said&#44;  I live here and mine usually takes two cycles to dry.  And she expected that to be the end of it. Really? I explained that I have never had to dry clothes in 3 cycles before. She seriously looked annoyed with me and proceeded to ask me if I wanted maintenance to look into it. Again&#44; Really? Shouldn t that be something that is offered when a tenant has concerns about an appliance? I left the office that day with a bad taste in my mouth.

My most recent encounter&#44; I called the office to inquire about a garage. One of the staff (I don t recall her name) answered with  Spruce Run Apartments.  and when I explained who I was&#44; she just replied  Yes?  No friendly greeting at all! 
When I came to the office&#44; having made my decision to get the garage&#44; I walked in and Rebecca did say hello&#44; but again&#44; it was not a welcoming atmosphere. When I said that I called earlier about the garage&#44; she asked another staff member if she spoke with me (please note that this is the woman from my first encounter)&#44; and this lady didn t acknowledge me at all. She just went in the back to get the garage opener. Rebecca then told me how much it would be&#44; and printed out the paper work for me to sign. While I was signing&#44; she laid the opener down in front of me. Once I was done signing&#44; she took the paper and the check and didn t say anything else. So I sat there because I thought there might be something more to the process. When she didn t say anything&#44; I asked if we were done and she replied&#44;  Yep&#44; that s it. . No type of prior acknowledgment that our interaction was done and no friendly  Good-Bye  or  Have a Nice Day .
And there is more. Once I got home&#44; I discovered that the side of the garage that I rented was full of someone s personals. So I called the office and Rebecca answered&#44; and I explained who I was and that I was just in the office about the garage&#44; and she only replied&#44;  Yes? . I went on to explain about the personals in my side of the garage&#44; and she said that she would call the other tenant to find out about this. I never received a call back. So I called the next day and spoke with Rebecca again&#44; and again it was a very impersonal phone call. When I asked if she spoke with the other tenant about the garage&#44; she said that she got their voice mail and said that she could only assume that they will move their items if they got her message. Really?? I just paid you for the use of a garage that I cannot use until the other tenants moves their stuff. And there was absolutely no concern about this from her end. She should have had diligent follow up to ensure that this situation gets resolved. So right now&#44; I am paying for another tenant to store their stuff. Last night I came home late and there were no parking spots close to my apartment&#44; so I had to park around the corner. I couldn t even park in the garage that is right across from my apartment. So&#44; anyone can appreciate how angered I am about this situation. 

I believe that the Spruce Run staff seriously needs a lesson in friendly customer service or they should take a tip from Dawn. 
I should state that I have absolutely no complaints about my apartment or the community. I just have an issue with the staff. 

I am seriously debating if I even want to renew my lease here. The vibe that I get is that the staff could care less anyway. ",1,False

112295840,561368844433432,"I moved into this condominium on June 11, 2018 and rented from owner Gerald and Donna Kramer. I rented apartment 2 G. The apartment is located on the second floor facing West at the front of the building. At the time I rented the apartment, there was a family living there with a lot of furniture, and I was unable to do a thorough inspection. My experience: From day one I had nothing but problems. I submitted my application on May 10, 2018 for the rental at $1600 per month to a property management company in Delray beach along with a $100 check for the application, a $125 check for the elevator usage, and gave a $1600 deposit to the real estate agent Mike K. from Keller Williams. My lease for apartment two G was supposed to begin on June 8, 2018. This is when all the problems began. The property management company told me they approved my lease within a 48 hour period and it was up to the condo association at Boca View to bring me in for an interview. I called the president of the condo association Diana repetitively trying to schedule an interview, and after I identified myself on the phone to her, she claimed she could not hear me and would hang up the phone. This happened three times on three separate dates. I contacted the landlord Gerald Kramer who connected with the condo association president Diana who got me in for an interview with herself three days prior to my lease beginning. Their delay in approving me as a tenant within a timely manner caused me to have to pack a three bedroom house and hire a mover on short notice paying double the amount it should have cost me, causing tons of unnecessary aggravation for myself and my family and everyone else involved. The whole approval process was handled completely unprofessionally. This should have been my first sign to back out of the lease. Upon moving into apartment 2 G, I was provided with one key for the entrance to the building. I have a family of three and we are all listed on the lease. Even though it was specified in my lease that I needed three keys, the landlords Gerald and Donna Kramer attempted to gain an additional $75 deposit which was not agreed to. The landlord claimed he did not have the keys and I needed to get it them from Diana, the condo association president. Diana on the other hand claimed I needed to get the additional keys for my family from the landlord. The lack of communication between the owners and the property management is inexcusable. My last name was never added to the intercom at the front door to buzz guests in, despite numerous times asking both the landlord and Diana. Within a few days of my tenancy, we noticed a putrid smell coming from the guest bathroom. Although we cleaned the bathroom thoroughly we could not understand where the stench was coming from. During the first week of our stay we had nothing but problems. Apartment Two G had an infestation of roaches and sugar ants. Although the landlord did send a handyman in who sprayed Raid Bug Spray in the apartment, the roaches continued the to thrive. The first week in the apartment the master bathtub stuffed up, the master bathroom toilet bowl would not flush and the guest bathroom toilet bowl would not flush without holding the handle down. The spinner at the bottom of the dishwasher continuously banged every time you ran a cycle. There is construction going on at the Camino Real bridge. At the time I signed the lease I was told the construction was all underground and I would not hear noise. Apartment 2 G faces the front of the building , and it literally sounded like a war zone being in that apartment every day. The amount of noise was as if we were sitting in the middle of the construction site. This went on Monday through Saturday. After about one week of being there, realizing the apartment had an infestation of bugs, an odor of feces, and numerous other problems, I contacted an attorney to get me out of the lease. The landlords agreed to mutually terminate the lease. At this point I began emptying out cabinets including the kitchen and the guest bathroom. Upon emptying out the cabinets I found black mold growing up the walls behind the cabinet drawers. Please see the attached photos. Both of the bathrooms have pipe leaks which was causing the mold to grow. I reported this to the Code Enforcement department in Boca Raton and spoke directly with Dennis Spellman. There is a report on file. The mold was reported to the health department. The master bedroom walls are extremely thin and I could hear the person snoring in the next apartment. Additionally, the walls in the bathroom are also very thin and I could hear children taking baths coming from above on a nightly basis. The apartment was rented out with water and cable included. I was never informed that the building has a contract with DIRECTV, and they require all the tenants and owners to purchase the cable boxes at a cost between $100 and $200 per box. I Spoke with DIRECTV, and I was told that this is an arrangement that was put in force by the condo association. You are not allowed to rent the cable boxes, you must purchase them. As far as the building in general is concerned, here are my thoughts. Boca View is located about two blocks from the beach. The location is ideal and it&apos;s a beautiful street. The building itself is very old. There are air fresheners in the majority of outlets on every floor that let out a very perfumey type of smell. In my opinion, the air fresheners are used to hide the smell of must. There are cameras everywhere in the building, but I did not see this as a problem. The sauna in the building is gross as is the shower that is adjacent to the sauna. The pool area is mediocre and sits on top of the garage with zero shade and zero atmosphere. There are washers and dryer&apos;s on each floor, three washers and three dryers. It is a genuine pain in the butt to have to bring all your laundry down hallways and sit around and wait for everything to be completed so the next person can use it. Also I did not feel the dryers dried clothes efficiently and each cycle required excess usage. The noise from the construction is absolutely horrendous and will be going on for approximately 18 months. In addition to the constant loud noise, in order to get to a grocery store one must now drive to Hillsboro or Palmetto because the Camino Real bridge is shut down. The only positive to living in this building that I could see was the location to the beach, and the $1600 a month rent. But be warned, you do get what you pay for. I spoke to numerous tenants and homeowners in the building, and from what I learned, the majority of the reviews that I have read are all true. There is a ton of dissatisfaction and unpleasantries within the building experienced by everybody I encountered. I would absolutely not recommend this building to anybody, and I thank gosh my attorney was able to get me out of this lease and I only experienced two weeks of this hell. It is unfathomable to me that it is legal to rent out an apartment with mold. Yes, it is legal. There should be full disclosure just as if somebody was purchasing a home. Living in this home for two weeks exposed myself and my young children to black mold which could have seriously jeopardized our health. I thank gosh that I caught onto the problems experienced within this apartment at the very beginning of the lease, and I am extremely grateful to be out. The landlords did agreed to refund all my money minus the prorated amount for the rent of two weeks that I spent there. The day that I was to meet their assistant to return my keys, The landlord Gerald Kramer tried to back out of our legal agreement, and was trying to deduct $1600 from the amount of money he owed me, and claimed he was at a loss for the realtors commission therefore I should be penalized. Thankfully I had a legal agreement in writing with all signatures, so he ended up paying me what was owed to me. This is my warning to anybody considering apartment Two G. I would run like hell in the opposite direction. Please take a look at the photos attached. These were all taken with in the apartment. Completely disgusting. Look at the amount of mold that was hidden behind cabinets. I can only imagine what was behind the walls.",1,False

112445338,562597548990815,"Back in August when we were looking for a new home we stumbled across patio Gardens. We came in and we spoke to the property manager Emerson Peña. At first he was very informative and professional and very kind but then again who isn&apos;t when they are trying to fill in spaces and vacant apartments. The past eight months that I&apos;ve lived here, I have repeatedly asked for maintenance issues to be fixed but unfortunately property management Emerson seems to let this fall below wayside. Emerson is extremely nice and personable when he is trying to sign people up for an leasing agreement but once you do he seems to not care about your safety or well-being. We have noticed that the property is always muddy and wet. The laundry facilities that are provided on this property are not well kept or secure. On many occasions my husband and I have walked in the laundry facilities to find drug paraphernalia. Emerson doesn&apos;t seem to think this is an issue. It&apos;s gotten so bad within the last couple of months that my husband no longer lets me or feels comfortable with me doing laundry without him. About two weeks ago we went to do laundry and one of the facilities and found a homeless person shooting up heroin. We had to call the cops and file a report but still nothings been done about this issue.. Since we&apos;ve moved into this facility our garage has been broken into twice and again nothing has been done. This place is also infested with bugs which has been brought to Emersons attention but has done nothing about this issue. We live in an apartment where we can&apos;t even lock our back door because it&apos;s not properly placed and latches are broken that&apos;s also been brought to his attention but has yet to do anything about it. I&apos;ve brought this up to my husband&apos;s attention and actually have had a couple of arguments as to why he refuses to confront Emerson about set issues . Recently my husband has been avoiding going into the property management office. I found it to be kind of odd because he would always refuse to go into the office When Emerson is there. After recently talking to my husband and asking him why he avoids the management office at all cost he has revealed that Emerson the property manager has been sexually harassing him. Emerson waits until you are alone and have no witnesses. After recently talking to my husband and asking him why he avoids the management office at all cost he has revealed that Emerson the property manager has been making sexual unwanted innuendos. Emerson discusses sexual acts with other people with my husband again and unwanted. Emerson has also has physically touched my husband, such as brief back rubes and unwanted hand placement. Emerson waits until he is alone in the office with one person to make these sexual advances and unwanted sexual comments and unwanted sexual physical contact. After finding all this out I finally understand his behavior and treatment towards us. I have finally had enough with the property management in this facility. I have contacted his supervisor which has yet to contact me. My husband and I feel so uncomfortable that we are just waiting for our lease to end. But to be honest with you I feel that Emerson the property manager should be fired for sexually harassing his tenets. I am not sure how many men have experience this and have not said anything whether it be of simple embarrassment or shame, such as my husband. Which is why I leave this review anonymously in fear of repercussions. We will be filing charges against Emerson the property manager for sexually harassing my husband . It is sad to see such a beautiful place being managed by such a person like this man. It&apos;s all an act to get you to sign on the doted line. Emerson has been nothing but rude to myself (female) since we signed our lease agreement so much so that he that I truly feel sick to my stomach when I have to go into this office knowing there&apos;s a chance he&apos;ll be there. I&apos;ve started going out of my way to know when he isn&apos;t in the office so I am able to reload my laundry card which by the way is the only way you can load a card since we moved in here because the online site seems to always have issues as well. This has also been an issue that has been disregarded. It is sad to see such a beautiful place being managed by such a unprofessional, rude person like Emerson. Emerson has been nothing but rude to myself since we signed our lease agreement so much so that he has made me uncomfortable being alone in a room with him I avoid him at all cost and only go into the office when his assistant Christian is available. Christian has been nothing but kind and professional and understanding with my issues with this property manager. If anyone is looking for a new place I highly advise you to avoid this place at all cost don&apos;t get me wrong it is a beautiful place full with trees and beautiful flowers everywhere which is why we wanted to live here in the first place. But not worth the headache. I&apos;ve been reading reviews on this page and I see nothing but five stars but it seems to me that these five stars are being left by people interested in living here not tenets. I also seem to see a trend of tenants that actually live here that are very unsatisfied with management. I highly suggest you avoid this place at all cost until the property owner decides to change management .",1,False
