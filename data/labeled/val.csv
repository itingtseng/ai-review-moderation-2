I like that there are always parking spaces for me and that the parking is covered. Most of the times the complex is quite and the neighbors are respectful. I wish we didnt have to pay the trash fee because i could literally walk to the trash slot down the hall and throw away the bag myself. Besides that i think for the price the apartments are acceptable.,real_apartment_review

En la administración Mariela es una persona agradable y siempre respuesta a ayudar a los demas, el resto no sirve para nada. Los apartamentos son viejos y no se invierte en mejorarlos lo unico que hacen es remendar lo que se va rompiendo. Los vecinos no respetan el uso de mascarillas en las areas comunes y la administracion no have nada al respecto. Te acosan con cartas/comunicados todo el tiempo por cosas absurdas. Las areas comunes suelen estar sucias y con basura, muchas veces encuentras pipi de mascota en los elevadores. No hay parking asignado a los inquilinos. El gimnasio es de risa, todo viejo y roto. La piscina lleva cerrada un año. El jefe de mantenimiento es agradable y siempre resuelve rapido pero sus empleados son horribles y maleducados. Lo mejor del lugar es su ubicación y silencio.

The two main issues I had during my 1 year lease were these: 1. Moved in the middle of the month. Asked for rent to be prorated. Staff tried to prorate it from &quot;market value&quot;, which, for half the month, was less than $100 cheaper than our full monthly amount. Had to talk to 3 different staff members 4 different times to get it lowered. 2. Half the outlets in our house were broken. The AC was broken for a couple nights (in the summer), and it was leaking all the time. The shower handle broke, and the sink clogged, and maintenance never fixed it. They&apos;d call the least responsive tenant we had living with us and say they couldn&apos;t get in, even when we left notes on the door telling maintenance to come in. Other than that, it seems like half the staff have brains made out of bricks. If you try to reason with them, you get the same answer that doesn&apos;t make any sense. If you want to get anything done, DO NOT SPEAK TO ANNABELLE. She is rude, sassy, and unhelpful. Some other tenants had the AC broken with a newborn baby in the house and she took more than 10 days to resolve. it. Maintenance didn&apos;t even know it was broken because she never told them. Apparently she was just intending never to let it get fixed. She argues with everyone and just makes up excuses why she can&apos;t do her job. I quite frankly don&apos;t understand how she still has a job there. The only way to get anything done is to ask to speak to Bernadette. She&apos;s a shrewd businesswoman, but reasonable and workable. I have high respect for her, and wish her other office staff were as competent so that she didn&apos;t always have to come in and clean up the mess.",real_apartment_review

The new kid at the front gate with all the tattoos keeps calling me &#34;foo&#34;. Another one has asked me if I would buy him a pack of smokes at 7-11 if he gave me the money. There&#39;s a older black guy that is really nice but he smells like alcohol all the time. My job requires me to be on call so I&#39;m always driving in and out all day so I suppose I come into contact with these guys more than most everyone else. I&#39;ve held my tongue but one of the kids working up there has made several unapropriate comments to my teenage daughters. I asked him to stop talking to them when they walk through the gate and his reply was &#34;aight whatever&#34;. I can&#39;t remember the big guys name but anytime I had an issue he would always take care of it right away. And now I&#39;m stuck dealing with &#34;management&#34; which by the way is just one person&#44; her name is Gaby. She appears to be really nice but when I was waiting in the office to pay my rent last month I overheard her saying some extremely mean and vulger things about a tenant to another tenant. Some of the things she was gossiping about were highly personal and confidential things. So my faith and willingness to talk to &#34;management&#34; is weak. The security at the gate are the 1st people you will meet when you come to rent here&#44; the management will be the second persons you will meet when coming to rent. Both are unprofessional&#44; uncooperative&#44; and extremely unqualified to be trusted with your personal information. With that being said&#44; who cares what the apartments are like!,real_apartment_review

This became obvious when my apartment was burglarized by someone who simply rammed or kicked their way in. The deadbolt easily split and tore the old wood of the door frame. The police didn&#39;t respond until six hours after I originally reported it. I suspect they were busy with other problems&#44; as the area is one of the worst in town. They finally arrived to take my report and leave&#44; but of course I never got any of my belongings back&#44; as only about 5&#37; of property crimes in the area are ever solved. Management replaced the door and frame&#44; but it didn&#39;t seem much safer afterwards.<br><br>Loud music was an occasional issue&#44; but the worst noise came from the big C-130s from D-M AFB&#44; which flew over regularly and had the added feature of triggering many car alarms.<br><br>The apartments are spacious and relatively inexpensive&#44; but this also attracts a bad element. I was never sure who my neighbor really was&#44; because I saw at least seven different people coming and going regularly&#44; and even some others occasionally. Of course it&#39;s normal to have visitors&#44; but I suspect that several families were living there at the same time. Parking was a problem because all these people took the few remaining guest parking spots. When they argued (which was often)&#44; I could hear all of it. They sometimes sat out front in an old pickup truck with the engine running&#44; and the exhaust smoke wafted through my entire apartment&#44; even with the windows and door tightly sealed. The police and sheriffs were frequently in the complex for various problems. Around midnight one night&#44; there was a drive-by shooting in the next building down. After that&#44; I got out and stayed out.,real_apartment_review

These repairs were brought to the managements attention on March 8th 2007 (was told by the landlord that a worker would come after lunch no worker came to the apartment) March 9th 2007 (was told by the landlord that that the worker was sent to the wrong address the day before and that the oven/fan would be replaced later that day no worker came to the apartment)&#44; March 22nd 2007 (was told by the landlord that the fan would be repaired and oven replaced first thing in the morning no worker came to the apartment). As allowed under the Arizona Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (section 33-1362) a licensed contractor will be brought in ten days after receipt of this notice to perform repairs/replacements on/of the oven and ceiling fan&#44; the cost of these repairs and/or replacements will be deducted from the next months rent unless the landlord addresses the problems within the ten day window specified under the law.<br>2. Deduction of next month s rent for failure to provide water/hot water and fit premises. Informed the landlord that there was no water to the building on March 22nd&#44; 2007 (was told that a employee from Tucson Water had replaced meters earlier in the day and was to look at the problem before he left but he didn t do it &#44; also was told that the water company guaranteed a 6:oo a.m. repair job and was given a key to a vacant apartment for access to water) The apartment the tenants were given a key to was filthy and un-usable due to health concerns (see photos marked) The tenants called Tucson Water at 7:00 a.m. on March the 23rd 2007 to inquire on the status of the repair and was informed that the water had been turned off for non-payment of the bill. As a result of the failures by the landlord to maintain fit premises and wrongful failure to supply essential water service under the Arizona Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (sections 33-1324 and 33-1364) the tenants find the landlord has committed a breach of contract. <br>,real_apartment_review
