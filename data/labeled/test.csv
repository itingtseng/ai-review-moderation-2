There is no attempt at snow removal. When you call them about it they tell you there is nothing they can do. Seriously? I have witnessed many resident shoveling there own drive way just to get out. We are talking like parking spots and the street. Very bad apartments.,real_apartment_review

I would have moved alot sooner&#44; but In elko there&#39;s not that many options.For starters the units are very poorly constructed and have not been updated/remodled I think ever. The carpet is awful and they put the cheapest paint inside so that if you try to wash the walls it comes off. The carpet might look clean when you first move in but after awhile you&#39;ll start noticing stains&#44; that&#39;s because when they replace the carpet they don&#39;t replace the padding&#44;gross I know! The maintenace is awful. If a appliance breaks down they&#39;ll replace it with another used appliance from another unit. The management is the worst part of living there. They are very&#44;very unproffesional. You will recieve nasty messages on your door all the time&#44; treating you like your doing them a favor living there. I have been in the office paying rent and heard them talking about other residents in a very inappropriate way! Also the apartments were built so cheaply that your can hear everything that happens in your neighbors apartment even just talking on the telephone.,real_apartment_review

We moved in at the end of March 2019 and loved the apartment and the community. After 3 months, we began smelling marijuana in our apartment. Since this is a &quot;non smoking&quot; community, it was a bit of a shock to have our master bedroom and bathroom stinking from marijuana smell. So, I called and complained. The complex did what it always does which is to send a letter to each apartment saying not to smoke. Every month after that, we complained about the smell filling our apartment. In September of 2019 we were still having the issue and the complex would never come to actually check out the problem. Finally it got so bad that after numerous complaints, the complex decided to evict our neighbors months later. The neighbors somehow found out we complained and vandalized our vehicles. They broke my windshield on my car and also the side mirror of my partner&apos;s car. This was allowed to occur because the complex gave the tenants a week to move instead of just taking care of it right away. We had to call the police and file a report. At this point, I had had enough and went into the office to complain. The manager at the time offered no help whatsoever so I had to go to the District Manager to finally get results. After the neighbors got evicted, that apartment was empty for a month or 2 and we did not have the smoke problem. Then after getting new neighbors, we had the same problem. Our bathroom and bedroom began smelling of marijuana. We complained and got the usual response of &quot;we&apos;ll send a letter and call&quot;. One day while leaving my apartment, I found a baggie of marijuana laying on the stairs. I took a picture and emailed it to the office and their response was that they found it hard to believe that there was a bag of weed left on the steps. So now, the complex started downplaying our complaints and making us feel like we were lying about the issue. We had this issue with the smoke most of this year and NOT A SINGLE person had come to our apartment to check out the issue until we finally just went over the property&apos;s head to the District Manager yet again. The new DM finally pushed for our apartment to get looked at 1.5 years later. The construction guy for our property checked out our apartment and the smoking neighbor&apos;s apartment and acknowledged that the marijuana was from the neighbors. He sealed around the pipes which was a 5 minute fix and it has actually helped now. FIVE MINUTES!!!!! That is all the time tit took to fix the issue after 1.5 years. This could have been taken care of months and months ago if only this complex cared about it&apos;s tenants to actually come inspect the problem. So, I stated I wanted compensation for the year and a half of neglect, the copious amounts of cleaners and air fresheners we bought, the electricity and water used to constantly re-wash our bedding to get rid of the smell, and for the overall horrible experience. They offered us $500. $500 for 1.5 years of nonsense. What a slap in the face. They sent people to shampoo our carpets and one of the guys entered into our apartment without wearing a mask during this time of Covid-19 which potentially puts us at risk for infection. I have so many pictures of trash being strewn about, pictures of people smoking in this community, and pictures of how disgusting the breezeway gets from the valet trash guys. I would never recommend this community to anyone until they enforce the non-smoking policy in the lease and get people in the office who actually try to fix the problems of their tenants instead of making them feel insignificant.",real_apartment_review

Website like this is to help better what is wrong not to put unnecessary business out there. There is a time and place for that and this is not the place. How would you like it if someone knew you was a bad mother&#44; kept a dirty unit&#44; had lives in in government housing and this is the real reason why you was evicted...not because of someone else. The world is not prefect and you are not either. You can get your point across in a more professional way. By the way if you do want to get your point across it would help to spell simple words right...they do offer classes for single mothers...take advantage of this while you are taking advantage of the government assistance that you seem to down all the time. Just saying be about something and better than coming on a webpage just to put someone down. There are better things to do...like take care of your children and rasie them right...hopefully they won&#39;t use the government like their parents and be more productive in their lives. Have you ever thought that they have kids and their kids read things like this...how would you feel if your child read your name personally...just saying be about something and not always the negative ones. Nothing in life is prefect...if it was then you would not need any help.,real_apartment_review

You develop your personal connections with the friends around. The office staff is very friendly, they respond to your needs. The emergencies are handled promptly. Other requests get dealt with in turn. It feels like a nice private isolated place. Always felt at home. I do not have roaches, I deal with them myself. Every six months, I spray with cedar oil and disperse boric acid in powder. This property has a lot of scenery, has a lot of blooms, the trees are so green or blooming. You can take a walk in the evening, christmas decorations are great at Holidays. I could have moved, but I did not want to.. I lived before at other places, but I like this the most.
