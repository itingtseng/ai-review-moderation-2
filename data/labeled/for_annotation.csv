Shortly after being approved for the apartment and had paid all of the required fees to reserve the space, I was told that the date that was originally given to me to move was no longer available. They asked me to move a week away from the original date. They did not try to accommodate me with an alternative option since it was their error in the first place. Seeing that I am not from the area I asked for a refund to find a place that could accommodate the original move in date. I was told that I would have to wait 2-4 weeks to receive a full refund because the refund comes from corporate. Now I have to spend extra money on admin, app, and deposit fees because of their lack of professionalism with their scheduling move in dates. Also, one of the male staff members hung up in my face when I was expressing my concern about the situation and how it was handled. The price for this place is awesome but the lack of professionalism is not worth the hassle.",real_apartment_review

Nice neighbors everyone kept to themselves and very safe with all of the surveillance and only key access doors. The staff were excellent lead by an exceptional Manager Tina who was very easy to work with always available for my living needs and very nice and professional at all times.

I would have moved alot sooner&#44; but In elko there&#39;s not that many options.For starters the units are very poorly constructed and have not been updated/remodled I think ever. The carpet is awful and they put the cheapest paint inside so that if you try to wash the walls it comes off. The carpet might look clean when you first move in but after awhile you&#39;ll start noticing stains&#44; that&#39;s because when they replace the carpet they don&#39;t replace the padding&#44;gross I know! The maintenace is awful. If a appliance breaks down they&#39;ll replace it with another used appliance from another unit. The management is the worst part of living there. They are very&#44;very unproffesional. You will recieve nasty messages on your door all the time&#44; treating you like your doing them a favor living there. I have been in the office paying rent and heard them talking about other residents in a very inappropriate way! Also the apartments were built so cheaply that your can hear everything that happens in your neighbors apartment even just talking on the telephone.,real_apartment_review

We came and viewed a beautiful remodeled apartment, not knowing that we were to view another apartment (because of COVID you take your self on the tour). We fell in love and we exclaimed to Alisha that it was the one we wanted. It&apos;s the day we move in and I&apos;m talking to Trinity (my sweet sweet friend I didn&apos;t know worked there) telling her how excited I was to move in to the beautiful all white and silver applianced apartment.... the girls in the office (all absolutely fabulous btw) say OH NO you viewed an apartment that was already rented out you were supposed to view the one across from it (not remodeled how we wanted but still beautiful nonetheless.) This definitely came as a big shock, we walk into the apartment we were to live in and it was great but not what we were expecting. Feeling sad and walking back to the lobby....BUT when we get back to the office manager Terra has the beautiful idea to remodel our apartment. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXCITED. Terra was so gracious throughout the time we walked in that door. We are all a little younger and we had previously gotten turn down at apartment because of our age. But Audubon felt like home when we walked in they made us feel like we belong here and I can&apos;t wait to spend a few of my years here. The apartment is now finished and I am now able to write all my thoughts down. This place is amazing, we have a sweet beautiful black lab and he had a window he can over look the dog park (which is great btw living in an apartment can be hard for a dog and the park gives him some freedom and excitement to play with other dogs.) Also my white cabinets, new countertops, and new beautiful lighting and new appliances are so beautiful it&apos;s like an apartment you always dream of having BUT ITS REAL LIFE. I work from home and so I am in the apartment almost 25/8 and I have a wonderful desk that I get to stare at my beautiful apartment all day while I work and it honestly has made working so much better and relaxing. While they remodeled we were living in the apartment and I&apos;m here all day and it was never an issue or ever annoying. It was exciting and the remodeling staff are so great everyone always wore mask coming in and that made me feel very comfortable during these hard time. Summer is one of the most hardworking women I have ever seen I literally love her she&apos;s a rockstar, she would come in and handle it if it was wrong and it was nice to see someone who cared so much and was so fired up about their job. COME LIVE HERE it&apos;s more than amazing!! The amenities you get, a staff who cares, the location, I love it. Thank you to all of the staff for all that you are doing it really means so much.",real_apartment_review

The only complaint i may have is that most apartment complexes you drop trash in compactor and push button to compact it, here tenant puts trash in compactor and member of staff comes by and compacts it at later time. Because of that at least one a month trash compactor over flows and bags full of trash lay all over sidewalk outside of compactor. This is fault of poor design of complex designers, more than staff not checking compactor regularly. Staff are very friendly and maintenance issues are dealt with quickly. Great family atmosphere and close to many shops and food places.",real_apartment_review

All love for the on-site staff. I&apos;d had small issues once the building transferred to their current owners Draper and Kramer but but the Major issue occurs when at the end of the first quarter 2020 I was furloughed from my job due to the pandemic. On top of that I had to leave the country for a family emergency at the same time, I was only meant to leave for 1 week however, when I tried to return I was denied access by the presidential proclamation putting a ban on Non-citizens of the US and I have not been able to enter the US since... Since then I had been in very positive conversations with Draper and Kramer. We were in discussion and agreed to a settlement and me immediately remotely handing over the space. All was solved I thought until a few weeks later I received calls from a collection agency called IQ-Data. They harassed and abused me verbally over an apparent due balance from Draper and Kramer. I immediately disputed the balance and I called up Draper and Kramer and they refused to talk to me on numerous occasions for no reason at all.... I never heard back from the collections agency after I disputed. Until recently I noticed an impairment on my credit report from them in reference to this property. I am still abroad and not able to return to my job and life in the US I am in a very precarious situation and my future has been damaged by this act by Draper and Kramer for no reason at all. To future and current residents take living at a Draper and Kramer property with a pinch of salt. Should an extra-ordinary event happen to you, they will feed you to the dogs, even if you do agree to a fair resolution. Draper and Kramer please get in-touch so we can resolve this.",real_apartment_review

I have some comments if you decide to move to this place. Please read this before you make the decision. 1. If you have sleep problems, do not live here. Young kids are partying all the time. Also, since this is located at middle of Tempe, there are lots of night clubs around. Because this apartment have no ability to block these noises. Noise pollution is extremely serious. 2. You will not have hot water all the time. Usually, after 12 am. There will not be any hot water to use. Also, it happens randomly during the week too. It had happened to me at least twice a week. Specially around the holiday, they will shut down all hot water. Like in this Christmas. I have no any hot water for 3 days. (Not take any shower for 3 days too). When you call them to fix this. It will be fix really soon. But you only have 1 hour to use hot water. After that, cold water is the only option. Or~ you could call them again. Even though you tell them that there need a explanation. They will not explain anything for you. 3. I live here for 2 years. Gym close for 5 months. And it close again for updates. Do not know when will open again. 4. Really be careful when you sign the lease. I was told that I got 100 $ off every month in the first year. It did not happen after I sign the lease. When I asked them why was that. They said they never do 100$ off. In the next year, when I decided to move out, they give me 100$ off for the next year. No one in the office telling people the truth. 5. Very low quality apartment, everything broke. When first time I moved here, The refrigerator is not working. And my Microwave have a huge damage inside. They said they were going to change it. But it has been 1 and half year. Still not changing at all.

I live on the 20th floor in unit #2013. I do not drink alcohol, do recreational drugs or have a criminal record; I am a professional investment banker at a global financial institution and my hobbies include reading and walking my dog. I am 24 years old and I moved into my current apartment right after graduating from college at Loyola University Maryland in May 2019 where I was a four-year division one student athlete as a member of the men’s lacrosse team. I have had consistent problems dealing with the staff of this community and the issues have never been acknowledged or improved despite my frequent emails to . Claire Rowland has been the “manager” of the leasing office since I moved in, but I do not think I have ever even seen her physically in the building; she has been on extended leave since June 2019. There has been an array of staff members over the last two years in the leasing office and the personnel has certainly been subject to frequent turnover. However, the concierge desk has had two employees which have been here for two years and work full time. These two employees are Yolanda Hamilton and “Steel”; Yolanda works typically during the daytime shift on Mon-Fri (9-5pm), “Steel” typically works the evening shift Mon-Fri (5pm-12 midnight). I have had consistent issues dealing with these two individuals beyond what is acceptable and it thus needs to be brought to the attention of the community as well as to the attention of prospective new tenants so they are aware of these potential drawbacks. Yolanda and Steel are both very unpolite, unprofessional, unhelpful, condescending and both display a variety of antisocial characteristics which typically would preclude one from working in a customer-facing hospitality role. Yolanda befriends others in the community that are similar to her, and upon any disagreement with her she has called her friends to support her arguments and help to her bully me into submission when I have a complaint or disagree with her about something. I will describe the events which took place last night to provide an example. The relevant time was approximately 9pm on Thursday, May 20th, 2021. I went to the lobby to borrow a trolly cart to help move large items in my room, and asked Steel if I could borrow the trolly, which was in a closet directly behind his desk. I saw the trolly cart literally not being used in the closet when I asked Steel if I could borrow the cart to move the items. He responded to my request, telling me “the cart was being used and you can come back later or we will call you when it is available.” Steel attempted to give the impression that there is only one trolly cart, and proceeded to be extremely rude and lost his temper when I asked why he was being so unhelpful and rude. I told Steel that his behavior was completely unacceptable in a professional environment, and I also informed him that he was not entitled to his current job, and that he could potentially lose his job for failing to uphold high standards of customer service, which are customarily required in a customer-facing role, in an apartment community of this type. Yolanda was in lobby at the relevant time, and told me that there was absolutely nothing they could do to help me. Meanwhile, the cart was right behind Steel in a closet which I saw with my own two eyes. I asked if they could at least try and call someone who could help with my request, and they continued to refuse and then started to ignore me when I continued to disagree with their response. I remained in the lobby to wait for the trolly to be made available, and during such time I expressed my opinion openly but calmly, exercising my rights pursuant to the first amendment of the constitution. Among other things, I said that Steel displayed many characteristics of one suffering from anger management issues, and that he should seek professional counseling to resolve these problems in the future. I said that Yolanda was condescending, intolerant and unable to have normal conversation with someone whose opinion was different from her own. I said that I believe this type of behavior is unacceptable in any social environment and is contrary to free expression which is a fundamental right in a democratic society. I asked Steel if he had ever had a girlfriend, out of pure curiosity and without pretense, to which I received no response. Steel had to leave the room for ten minutes because he had lost his temper; this happened three times during the events last night. Unhappy with what I was saying, Yolanda called one of her friends, “Detective Perez”, who upon coming to the lobby showed me his police badge as if to threaten me or something. I asked if he was going to arrest me for exercising my first amendment rights. He replied that he was not, as I was doing nothing contrary to established law. Unable to intimidate me so that I would leave the lobby, they instead proceeded to bully me and make me feel like I was the one who was wrong and acting unreasonably. Yolanda raised her voice at multiple times throughout the dispute, accusing me of “taunting her employees” and saying that “you need to mind your own business” or else “management will send you a letter”. The contents of such letter are still unknown to me at the current time. I have not received this letter from management as of the current time of this writing. I remained in the lobby, waiting for the trolly to become available. Eventually, a police officer arrived and entered the lobby, prompted by a phone call from Yolanda’s friend, “Detective Perez”, who is an employee of the Baltimore City of the Police Department. Detective Perez abused his power by calling upon the resources of the local government to support them in a social disagreement with no good cause. This alone is good cause for him to lose his badge and be permanently barred from representing the local government law enforcement. That matter concerning Detective Perez’s misconduct is outside the scope of this complaint, however, and will be addressed in a separate complaint to be filed with the Baltimore City Police Department in due course. Nonetheless, the police officer asked me what the issue was, and I informed him that I was exercising my first amendment rights while waiting for the trolly cart to be made available so that I could move large items out of my room. He proceeded to ask if he could see my idea four times which I refused on each separate instance, as he had to good cause to be making such a request and thus was abusing his discretion as a uniformed law enforcement agent on behalf of the Baltimore City Police Department. I asked if he was going to arrest me, to which he responded he was not, as I was not breaking the law but was only exercising the rights afforded to me under the first amendment of the United States Constitution. I went on to state that Yolanda was acting like a “crazy person” and was abusing her discretion while not even officially on duty as concierge, and that Steel was refusing to perform his responsibilities as concierge of the apartment community. Still refusing to make any effort to find a trolly cart as requested, they continued to ignore me and then proceeded to abuse their discretion once again by shutting down a social gathering occurring on the 28th floor by a tenant, who is perfectly within their rights to use the amenities of this community and was doing nothing manifestly improper by inviting their friends to gather in the common area of the 28th floor. I said that the gathering on the 28th floor was none of their business, to which Steel rolled his eyes once again, and Yolanda raised her voice responding that “you need to mind your own business”, to which I responded, “Or what? You have no authority to do anything to restrict my free speech rights”, to which she scoffed, in utter disbelief that I continued to refuse to obey her commands. It is of significance to note that the police officer was present during the entire dispute, for reasons unknown, which would appear to be a serious misallocation of law enforcement resources in a city which is plagued by over 300 homicides per year and faces an ongoing heroine epidemic, which unabated has created a humanitarian crisis in the city of Baltimore. Nevertheless, still unhappy with the course of events, Yolanda proceeded to call my mother in a last ditch attempt to get me to leave the lobby and end the dispute. This turned out to prove effective, and after she called me mother I gave up on waiting for the trolly cart and told all persons who were present that they should be deeply embarrassed of the events which transpired, and commented that it was completely unacceptable to call my mother and involve themselves in such a way in my own familial relationships. I was in utter disbelief that they would take it upon themselves to make my own mother stress that I was in some type of trouble when I was not, lying to her and saying that I was at risk of being arrested, when was indisputably false at all times last evening. This final action by Yolanda caused me to give up in waiting for the trolly cart and I returned to my room after this. I will no longer engage in any type of interaction with the staff of this building after what happened last night. This is the last of many issues I have had with them over the past two years, none of which have ever been addressed or resolved by the managers of the leasing office. They believe that this is appropriate conduct for the concierge and that they maintain the highest levels of customer service in the multifamily property market in Baltimore. This is absolutely untrue, and the customer service of this community is the sole reason I will not be renewing my lease in June and will be seeking living arrangements elsewhere, such as 414 Light Street. I advise prospective tenants to consider this conduct in weighing their decision to sign a new lease in this building, as there are a wide variety of alternative rental options in Baltimore which I believe offer superior customer service and are located in more attractive locations, altogether making these alternatives a superior value proposition to Luminary at One Light Street.",real_apartment_review

We moved in at the end of March 2019 and loved the apartment and the community. After 3 months, we began smelling marijuana in our apartment. Since this is a &quot;non smoking&quot; community, it was a bit of a shock to have our master bedroom and bathroom stinking from marijuana smell. So, I called and complained. The complex did what it always does which is to send a letter to each apartment saying not to smoke. Every month after that, we complained about the smell filling our apartment. In September of 2019 we were still having the issue and the complex would never come to actually check out the problem. Finally it got so bad that after numerous complaints, the complex decided to evict our neighbors months later. The neighbors somehow found out we complained and vandalized our vehicles. They broke my windshield on my car and also the side mirror of my partner&apos;s car. This was allowed to occur because the complex gave the tenants a week to move instead of just taking care of it right away. We had to call the police and file a report. At this point, I had had enough and went into the office to complain. The manager at the time offered no help whatsoever so I had to go to the District Manager to finally get results. After the neighbors got evicted, that apartment was empty for a month or 2 and we did not have the smoke problem. Then after getting new neighbors, we had the same problem. Our bathroom and bedroom began smelling of marijuana. We complained and got the usual response of &quot;we&apos;ll send a letter and call&quot;. One day while leaving my apartment, I found a baggie of marijuana laying on the stairs. I took a picture and emailed it to the office and their response was that they found it hard to believe that there was a bag of weed left on the steps. So now, the complex started downplaying our complaints and making us feel like we were lying about the issue. We had this issue with the smoke most of this year and NOT A SINGLE person had come to our apartment to check out the issue until we finally just went over the property&apos;s head to the District Manager yet again. The new DM finally pushed for our apartment to get looked at 1.5 years later. The construction guy for our property checked out our apartment and the smoking neighbor&apos;s apartment and acknowledged that the marijuana was from the neighbors. He sealed around the pipes which was a 5 minute fix and it has actually helped now. FIVE MINUTES!!!!! That is all the time tit took to fix the issue after 1.5 years. This could have been taken care of months and months ago if only this complex cared about it&apos;s tenants to actually come inspect the problem. So, I stated I wanted compensation for the year and a half of neglect, the copious amounts of cleaners and air fresheners we bought, the electricity and water used to constantly re-wash our bedding to get rid of the smell, and for the overall horrible experience. They offered us $500. $500 for 1.5 years of nonsense. What a slap in the face. They sent people to shampoo our carpets and one of the guys entered into our apartment without wearing a mask during this time of Covid-19 which potentially puts us at risk for infection. I have so many pictures of trash being strewn about, pictures of people smoking in this community, and pictures of how disgusting the breezeway gets from the valet trash guys. I would never recommend this community to anyone until they enforce the non-smoking policy in the lease and get people in the office who actually try to fix the problems of their tenants instead of making them feel insignificant.",real_apartment_review

I was told by the exterminator who was dispatched to my apartment, that after they treated another apartment near mine for cockroaches a few weeks earlier, that they strongly urged management to treat surrounding apartments - up an down- to prevent the spread of cockroaches to other apartments, and that management did not follow this professional advice - hence, the cockroaches made their way to my home. Though management made efforts to kill off the cockroaches in my apartment they were unsuccessful and I just couldn&apos;t take it any more after putting up with this for 2+ months so I moved out early. I did not get what I paid for during those cockroach months, including the use of my kitchen which had to be completely cleared out for one of the early cockroach treatments - and at that time I ceased bringing food into my home as further use of my kitchen was not in my best interest.

I did that, dropped it off within 2 days & the very next day she tells me that I won&apos;t be able to stay because a new tenant was assigned to my apartment.

There has been a drastic change.  I don&#39;t know why but most renter&#39;s are Indian.  They are unclean and many 3 room apartments are accomadating at least 4 people. 2 bedroom apartments accomodate many more.  It is not a nice place to live for the american people.  The Indian&#39;s scam in this complex&#44; owning homes in India and swiching living arrangements with there family when the renter&#39;s go back to India.  This is the worst place to live.  For some reason American born people are hit hard if they try to rent here.  However&#44; if your Indian  you get in much more easier.  The complex is probable about 90&#37; Indian with multiple families living in one aptmt.  Along with them comes filt&#44; bugs&#44; discuscting aptmts.  Its obvious&#44; Indian&#39;s are welcomed more than americans.  Had I known&#44; I would have not rented here.  The smell of curry makes me ill and gives me migraines.  I will be leaving as soon as I find another aptmt. OUT OF THIS COMPLEX.  The new upgrades they do are the cheapes possible for the rent they charge.  Water pressure is slow&#44; no sprayer&#39;s on sink faucets&#44; oven&#39;s are so cheap they don&#39;t even come with drip pans. Bathroom are redone at the minimal expense.

Regarding the plumbing issues being ignored for over 3 years but somehow the management is installing new fencing in the backyards is evidence to show that tenants health and wellbeing isnt important to the property manager Elba Cassiano. Instead of repairing our plumbing piping and cloggage for my whole building which is expensive my manager is trying to make the outside of these apartments attractive to people so they can benefit more money by trapping new tenants in a fake disgraceful contract of lies. They cant even keep up with repairs that currently not being resolved at all. But are ranking up more money for their own selfish gain. There has been 7 new managers in 2 years hiring inexperienced maintenance and it seems that Karya Property Management is a bunch of deceitful, manipulative, corrupt, artificial people who are examples of people who only do their job to get paid but have yet to care or respect for the other families who are such a big part of Karya Managements success and gain.

There are two sides, one side is for low-income section 8 tenants who pay very little rent, some pay no rent. The second side is for people who pay the full market rate value of rent with no government assistance. I was probably the only person paying normal rent in my section. The apartment staff will categorize which side you will move into when you 1st come into the office. Most apartments require you to make 3-4 times the rent. There is a section of the apartments with many people working low income, fast food/warehouse jobs earning $1200-$1500 a month who would normally NEVER qualify to live in any apartment over $400-$500 a month. If you get placed in that section it is best to not even move here. Because there is a mix of poor residents/section 8 welfare residents they send maintenance to inspect the apartments ever 3 months or sometimes even more frequently. You can have 4-5 inspections in your house per year. They are trying to see if the low-income residents have destroyed the property, or moved in extra people not listed on the lease. Speaking of which, there is a lot of overcrowding in these apartments. There are multiple families with tons of kids living in 2 bedroom apartments. There are people who admittingly don&apos;t have jobs living in these apartments and didn&apos;t have a job at the time of move in either. There is a ton of paper work to file out every year so that the government can make sure you are still poor enough to live here for those that pay the full market value of rent, they have very little paperwork. All in all, the apartments are well maintened but because they are mixed income they attract a lot of problems that typically occur in high poverty low income areas. Misbehaved disrespectful kids, un tended to pets,lots of domestic fights between pregnant baby mommas and live in boyfriends of the week. These apartments are pretty much the projects in the center placed in an upscale black neighborhood . They have driven the property value of the neighborhood down so I&apos;d avoid living in the county all together now. The sherfiff are always here for drug busts in the apartments.

Generally satisfied with apt and office mgmt until a year ago. Negative points of my apt are poor sound proofing with apt having lots of windows that are poorly insulated, resulting in high heating and A/C bills. Had little need for maintenance but when needed it came quickly. Last year I noticed change however in the office mgmt. with new manager showing herself more aggressive and not concerned with stepping on tenant rights. Examples: office began pressing tenants to renew their lease 6 months before lease termination even though lease allows up to 3 months to renew and the previous mgmt. always respected that. Six months before lease termination the office started to parade potential customers thru the apt. with the arrogance of letting themselves into the apt 2 seconds after knocking on the front door without bothering to wait for tenant to come down stairs to open the door. I suspect customer visits were staged to pressure the tenants to renew 6 months before lease termination since visits coincided with the letters to the tenants pressing them to renew and visits died off after the letters, although covid confinement also started soon after so not sure. Aside from that, entrance to apt garage is heavily sunken from underground water, making it difficult to drive the car into the garage without hitting the side, yet the new mgmt. never attempted to fix it. Neither were they willing to spend to fix problems in the apt windows and replace a cracked window pane.

My apartment itself was very large for the price and had a decent kitchen with newer appliances.The bathroom could be updated but wasn&#39;t bad at all. The laundry room in the basement was kept clean and the machines generally worked well if you didn&#39;t overload the machines. This was the best value I could find for the money&#44; considering heat is included in the rent as well. I was very happy there!,real_apartment_review

I live on the 20th floor in unit #2013. I do not drink alcohol, do recreational drugs or have a criminal record; I am a professional investment banker at a global financial institution and my hobbies include reading and walking my dog. I am 24 years old and I moved into my current apartment right after graduating from college at Loyola University Maryland in May 2019 where I was a four-year division one student athlete as a member of the men’s lacrosse team. I have had consistent problems dealing with the staff of this community and the issues have never been acknowledged or improved despite my frequent emails to . Claire Rowland has been the “manager” of the leasing office since I moved in, but I do not think I have ever even seen her physically in the building; she has been on extended leave since June 2019. There has been an array of staff members over the last two years in the leasing office and the personnel has certainly been subject to frequent turnover. However, the concierge desk has had two employees which have been here for two years and work full time. These two employees are Yolanda Hamilton and “Steel”; Yolanda works typically during the daytime shift on Mon-Fri (9-5pm), “Steel” typically works the evening shift Mon-Fri (5pm-12 midnight). I have had consistent issues dealing with these two individuals beyond what is acceptable and it thus needs to be brought to the attention of the community as well as to the attention of prospective new tenants so they are aware of these potential drawbacks. Yolanda and Steel are both very unpolite, unprofessional, unhelpful, condescending and both display a variety of antisocial characteristics which typically would preclude one from working in a customer-facing hospitality role. Yolanda befriends others in the community that are similar to her, and upon any disagreement with her she has called her friends to support her arguments and help to her bully me into submission when I have a complaint or disagree with her about something. I will describe the events which took place last night to provide an example. The relevant time was approximately 9pm on Thursday, May 20th, 2021. I went to the lobby to borrow a trolly cart to help move large items in my room, and asked Steel if I could borrow the trolly, which was in a closet directly behind his desk. I saw the trolly cart literally not being used in the closet when I asked Steel if I could borrow the cart to move the items. He responded to my request, telling me “the cart was being used and you can come back later or we will call you when it is available.” Steel attempted to give the impression that there is only one trolly cart, and proceeded to be extremely rude and lost his temper when I asked why he was being so unhelpful and rude. I told Steel that his behavior was completely unacceptable in a professional environment, and I also informed him that he was not entitled to his current job, and that he could potentially lose his job for failing to uphold high standards of customer service, which are customarily required in a customer-facing role, in an apartment community of this type. Yolanda was in lobby at the relevant time, and told me that there was absolutely nothing they could do to help me. Meanwhile, the cart was right behind Steel in a closet which I saw with my own two eyes. I asked if they could at least try and call someone who could help with my request, and they continued to refuse and then started to ignore me when I continued to disagree with their response. I remained in the lobby to wait for the trolly to be made available, and during such time I expressed my opinion openly but calmly, exercising my rights pursuant to the first amendment of the constitution. Among other things, I said that Steel displayed many characteristics of one suffering from anger management issues, and that he should seek professional counseling to resolve these problems in the future. I said that Yolanda was condescending, intolerant and unable to have normal conversation with someone whose opinion was different from her own. I said that I believe this type of behavior is unacceptable in any social environment and is contrary to free expression which is a fundamental right in a democratic society. I asked Steel if he had ever had a girlfriend, out of pure curiosity and without pretense, to which I received no response. Steel had to leave the room for ten minutes because he had lost his temper; this happened three times during the events last night. Unhappy with what I was saying, Yolanda called one of her friends, “Detective Perez”, who upon coming to the lobby showed me his police badge as if to threaten me or something. I asked if he was going to arrest me for exercising my first amendment rights. He replied that he was not, as I was doing nothing contrary to established law. Unable to intimidate me so that I would leave the lobby, they instead proceeded to bully me and make me feel like I was the one who was wrong and acting unreasonably. Yolanda raised her voice at multiple times throughout the dispute, accusing me of “taunting her employees” and saying that “you need to mind your own business” or else “management will send you a letter”. The contents of such letter are still unknown to me at the current time. I have not received this letter from management as of the current time of this writing. I remained in the lobby, waiting for the trolly to become available. Eventually, a police officer arrived and entered the lobby, prompted by a phone call from Yolanda’s friend, “Detective Perez”, who is an employee of the Baltimore City of the Police Department. Detective Perez abused his power by calling upon the resources of the local government to support them in a social disagreement with no good cause. This alone is good cause for him to lose his badge and be permanently barred from representing the local government law enforcement. That matter concerning Detective Perez’s misconduct is outside the scope of this complaint, however, and will be addressed in a separate complaint to be filed with the Baltimore City Police Department in due course. Nonetheless, the police officer asked me what the issue was, and I informed him that I was exercising my first amendment rights while waiting for the trolly cart to be made available so that I could move large items out of my room. He proceeded to ask if he could see my idea four times which I refused on each separate instance, as he had to good cause to be making such a request and thus was abusing his discretion as a uniformed law enforcement agent on behalf of the Baltimore City Police Department. I asked if he was going to arrest me, to which he responded he was not, as I was not breaking the law but was only exercising the rights afforded to me under the first amendment of the United States Constitution. I went on to state that Yolanda was acting like a “crazy person” and was abusing her discretion while not even officially on duty as concierge, and that Steel was refusing to perform his responsibilities as concierge of the apartment community. Still refusing to make any effort to find a trolly cart as requested, they continued to ignore me and then proceeded to abuse their discretion once again by shutting down a social gathering occurring on the 28th floor by a tenant, who is perfectly within their rights to use the amenities of this community and was doing nothing manifestly improper by inviting their friends to gather in the common area of the 28th floor. I said that the gathering on the 28th floor was none of their business, to which Steel rolled his eyes once again, and Yolanda raised her voice responding that “you need to mind your own business”, to which I responded, “Or what? You have no authority to do anything to restrict my free speech rights”, to which she scoffed, in utter disbelief that I continued to refuse to obey her commands. It is of significance to note that the police officer was present during the entire dispute, for reasons unknown, which would appear to be a serious misallocation of law enforcement resources in a city which is plagued by over 300 homicides per year and faces an ongoing heroine epidemic, which unabated has created a humanitarian crisis in the city of Baltimore. Nevertheless, still unhappy with the course of events, Yolanda proceeded to call my mother in a last ditch attempt to get me to leave the lobby and end the dispute. This turned out to prove effective, and after she called me mother I gave up on waiting for the trolly cart and told all persons who were present that they should be deeply embarrassed of the events which transpired, and commented that it was completely unacceptable to call my mother and involve themselves in such a way in my own familial relationships. I was in utter disbelief that they would take it upon themselves to make my own mother stress that I was in some type of trouble when I was not, lying to her and saying that I was at risk of being arrested, when was indisputably false at all times last evening. This final action by Yolanda caused me to give up in waiting for the trolly cart and I returned to my room after this. I will no longer engage in any type of interaction with the staff of this building after what happened last night. This is the last of many issues I have had with them over the past two years, none of which have ever been addressed or resolved by the managers of the leasing office. They believe that this is appropriate conduct for the concierge and that they maintain the highest levels of customer service in the multifamily property market in Baltimore. This is absolutely untrue, and the customer service of this community is the sole reason I will not be renewing my lease in June and will be seeking living arrangements elsewhere, such as 414 Light Street. I advise prospective tenants to consider this conduct in weighing their decision to sign a new lease in this building, as there are a wide variety of alternative rental options in Baltimore which I believe offer superior customer service and are located in more attractive locations, altogether making these alternatives a superior value proposition to Luminary at One Light Street.",real_apartment_review

The elevator maintenance issues last from 20 minutes to days. The building maintenance for small items takes for ever. The building does not have garbage chutes so the leaking fluid from all the residents remains in the elevators. The AC broke down multiple times and that took for ever to fix. The number of pets all using one small area is disgusting. The monthly bill consistently had unauthorized charges. The management drives the residents crazy to fill out positive reviews. We just moved out and they have listed all types of fee&apos;s taking up our entire deposit and asking for an additional 200. I rarely take the time to write reviews but I have to say this place is a HOT MESS.,real_apartment_review

Two weeks prior to move-in, they had a pipe burst which flooded almost the entirety of Tower #1. It has been 6 months since move-in, and there hasn&apos;t been a single day where the complex hasn&apos;t been inundated with some sort of construction crews, protective covering in the elevators, open holes in the walls of various hallways, and just general messiness caused by constant and continuous construction. They have been advertising a &quot;$2 million renovation project&quot; which could be the culprit of most of the construction, but I find it hilarious that it seems none of that $2 million was budgeted towards fixing the always-problematic elevators. Constant noise (construction during the day, parties at night), frequent water shutoffs, an indescribable amount of parking garage chaos (not to mention my car got broken into and robbed and W6 doesn&apos;t have adequate cameras), shootings, loud parties, lax security that doesn&apos;t take anything seriously, etc. Maintenance is fine from what I&apos;ve experienced and honestly, other than the nice view, maintenance is the only thing I can mark in the &quot;Pro&quot; column. Don&apos;t get up your high horse though, W6, everything else here is garbage. When we signed our lease (1/2020) we were told that the renovation construction would be started and completed by the time we moved in (08/2020). Instead, we&apos;ve been dealing with these renovations since we moved in. I come home from work and class every day wondering how I got tricked into signing a lease to live at an active construction site. Remember how you promised that by move-in time you&apos;d have a valet trash system too? I do, but you probably don&apos;t. Signs that say &quot;pardon my dust&quot; don&apos;t mean anything. W6 knows the problems they have, and to subdue the insane amount of complaints they get, they gave all residents $500 rent credit. Meanwhile, they actively run marketing campaigns offering potential new lessors an ENTIRE MONTH of rent for free with some units costing upwards of $4000 a month. That should be completely flipped. We, the current residents that have to deal with all these problems, deserve a free month of rent, and you can go offer whatever money you have left over to marketing and advertising for future lessors. What a joke. Just shows how much these dense people down in the leasing office actually care about their residents. If you choose to tour W6, listen to nothing they say and just take in information with what you can physically observe. If they show you the full complex, your observations are going be of an old and dying complex trying to extend it&apos;s shelf life with a bad and surface level $2 million facelift. Do a bit of digging and you&apos;ll find out what this place truly has to offer; cool views and nothing more. Imagine a tall Motel 6.",real_apartment_review

Tom pushes my brother into the ground, cursed at him, and then lied to the police about not putting hands in my brother. Tom took pictures, followed my brothers roommate to his door, pushed him against the THIRD FLOOR rail, and punched him and made him bleed. Tom would burst through their apartment door and tell them they couldn&apos;t have furniture here or there, couldn&apos;t have a fan on the window, couldn&apos;t close the doors a certain way, couldn&apos;t turn on the faucet a certain way, and pretty much gave them instructions on how to live and breathe. Now he is charging them about 1500 after they turned in the apartment and left it sparkly clean. And I say sparkly clean because I was a witness. He is crazy and racist.

In no country in the world is this even allowed where Illegal Immigrants can just roam free taking jobs&#44; renting apartments&#44; or houses. One thing for sure that hopefully the US Government will start cracking down on the rampant Illegal Immigration problem here in the USA which is well in excess of 30 million plus.

I first moved in January 2020 in a one bedroom and then upgraded to a 2 bedroom in December with my friend as a roommate. My first year was fine and I thoroughly enjoyed living here. However, once we moved into a new apartment, everything went down the drain. We have a lot of unfortunate incidents happen. First, our dishwasher broke and had dirty dish water sitting in the bottom. We had notified the maintenance staff immediately and they told me they would be out as soon as possible. Fast forward 2 weeks later, we called again to check the status of our maintenance ticket and we were told by the leasing staff that a maintenance ticket was never actually made. They then made one then. Fast forward another week and still nothing. We called again and finally someone came out a couple days later. At that visit, they told us they would need to order a part the dishwasher and that they would be there Friday to install. They never showed up Friday. I had to call again to demand what was going on. Finally, I got another call stating that we would be getting a brand new dishwasher and they would be there to install it the following Thursday. Thursday came around and they never showed up. We called the office again and we were informed a new dishwasher was never ordered. At this point, we had been going on a month without a dishwasher and the dirty water was causing our kitchen to smell horribly. Finally one day another maintenance man shows up to look at our current dishwasher and he magically fixes it. The next situation we have had is our loud downstairs neighbors. I have lived in apartments for almost 10 years and I understand there is no such thing as a quiet apartment. You&apos;re most likely to hear doors closing, people talking, TVs, etc. However, our downstairs neighbors are constantly playing heavy base music. It got to the point that we had to report it to the apartment office. I emailed them instead of calling because I wanted our interaction in writing. I never got a response but the apartment office put a note on the door. I would have appreciated a response letting me know the issue had been addressed or the message had been received. Our neighbors to this day still play blaring loud music so whatever they did to handle the situation did not work. The third situation we have run into is our other next door neighbors. Our next door neighbors have taken it upon themselves to leave handwritten notes on our door regarding us &quot;slamming&quot; our front door. We have offered to talk to our neighbors in person instead of through notes but they refuse. We reported it to the office and they told they would need to check with the property manager to see what the protocol is on this situation. We offered to write formal complaint but haven&apos;t heard back from the office. Long story short, I am no longer impressed by this complex and my roommate and I will be looking for a new apartment when I lease is up this Winter. Spare yourself the trouble and pay the higher price for a nicer apartment.",real_apartment_review

HQ Apartments is a very nice, albeit expensive, apartment building. I signed up for a tour about two weeks ago, providing my desired layout, square footage, and price range. Quenton was prepared to sell, even if it meant lying about the price I&apos;d be paying when I submitted my application. When touring this building, ask for ANYONE but him. After the tour was complete, we went back to his office to review the layouts and my options. He spent a very long time typing away on his computer and eventually told me he could bring unit #913, a 1 BR, 700 square foot apartment, from $1,550 to $1,425. I should have known it was too good to be true. I submitted my application and he told me he&apos;d take care of the rest. I checked in multiple times per week, and he would either avoid my calls or tell me he&apos;d call me the following day but never would. Quenton left me hanging for two weeks, repeatedly dodging me or claiming he was out of the office. Eventually, I requested to speak to the property manager to get a straight answer. When I ultimately spoke to their property manager, she apologized for the miscommunication and told me they could not rent that apartment for that low of a price. I am back on the hunt for an apartment, thanks to this sleazy, inexperienced and unprofessional individual.

PROS:
--A hella lot cheaper than any other apartments in Fishers (or lots of other northern-Indianapolis areas for that matter)
--The 2 bedroom/1 bath apartment is very spacious and had plenty of room for everything
--The grounds (except around the trash dumpsters) are very well maintained and look nice during all seasons
--Each apartment has its own entrance, which I prefer over sharing a hallway area with 3-7 other tenants

CONS:
--First warning: This is an income-restricted property (thus being cheaper than everywhere else), which means that if you make over $33,000 and have 2 people, you can&apos;t live here (at least that&apos;s what our limit was upon moving in)
--Our apartment was in the back section, which is literally across the treeline from I-69.  I sometimes opened the doors while sleeping once it got cooler outside and just got used to the LOUD road noise.  I never opened the front windows when home because it was just too loud, and don&apos;t even think of trying to watch TV with them open
--The apartment complex offers AT&T and some other local service for internet and TV.  I went with AT&T thinking that it would be at least decent.  Nope, it&apos;s DSL and it sucks (I heard that it is better service in the front of the complex as those apartments are closer to the incoming line from the road).  If Comcast ran a strong signal out to these buildings, they could make a killing because I swear 80% of the tenants would gladly switch
--The trash dumpsters are emptied twice a week (Monday and Thursday) but no efforts are made by anyone to clean up all of the overflow trash that comes from people being idiots and just putting their trash bags wherever or throwing mattresses and furniture in the dumpsters
--The appliances work but are dated a bit (it&apos;s the basic apartment collection of stove, fridge and dishwasher)
--The furnace setup is something I had not seen before.  It uses forced water from the water heater to heat the apartment, so there are two pipes coming out of the top of the furnace.  When I turned the A/C on, the seals around those pipes didn&apos;t do squat to seal the holes and a good majority of the cold air was escaping out of them instead of being pushed through the vents.  I also had to go around the edges of the furnace where the sheet metal was screwed together (rather haphazardly) and apply packing tape to block the air escaping from those cracks.  My apartment can only get itself cooled down to around 75 minimum, so fortunately for me I can stand it being a little warmer in my place
--Parking in front of the buildings can be a big hassle.  In the lease agreement, it says that only one car shall be parked in front of the buildings and all others (guest, spouse, moving truck) are to be parked in overflow parking.  This rarely happens and people just willy nilly invite their friends over and they just park wherever.  I always make it a point to tell people where to park, simply to be courteous if nothing else

Ok, so after all of those negatives, I have saved the most important one for last: The leasing staff.  When I was searching for apartments, I had about 2 weeks to move in before the lease was up on my old apartment (about 2 hours away).  I went into the Cumberland Crossings office and met with Jeremy.  He went through all of the necessary qualifications and paperwork needed, and everything seemed fine.  I filled out what I could and took the other pages that my wife needed to fill out (income and employment verification mostly).  Fortunately she was not working at the time, so we were able to slide in beneath the income cutoff level.  I took the paperwork in to Jeremy, and he looked it over and told me everything looked all set and that there shouldn&apos;t be any issues.  I asked him very clearly if that was the case and stated that I didn&apos;t want to learn two days from signing the lease that I was missing something and we couldn&apos;t get the apartment (because then we would have been homeless).  He assured me AGAIN that everything was set.......

On Wednesday afternoon, 2 days before we were planning on signing the lease and moving in, I get a call from Kathy, the other leasing consultant.  She informs me that I am missing some crucial paperwork and that there just doesn&apos;t seem any way that they are going to be able to lease to us.  Apparently I needed an employment verification form and previous apartment verification form, neither of which had I ever received from Jeremy, nor had he told me (when he had 2 opportunities to) that I was missing either.  I was furious and panicking.  Fortunately Kathy was willing to work with me to get what was needed.  I drove to the office and obtained (after trying for quite some time) the correct paperwork that was missing.  At that time, I didn&apos;t mention anything in regards to Jeremy&apos;s MAJOR mess-up since I was sort of at their mercy for giving us an apartment, but it royally ticked me off.  I think Jeremy is no longer working in the office (hopefully).

Ok, rant over.  Overall, the apartments are nice and maintenance has been quick to fix things for us (it is only 2 guys holding down 10+ buildings of apartments, so they do what they can).  Don&apos;t move in here expecting it to be anything like the other Fishers apartments, because it&apos;s not.  It&apos;s less expensive than all the others, and you get what you pay for.  My biggest piece of advice would be to make sure you obtain ALL necessary paperwork up front so you can avoid  the headache I went through (I got a wellness check the next day for work and my blood pressure was still elevated from the incident).",real_apartment_review

Don’t sign a lease with them you will regret it, possibly if another management group takes over it might become nice again but don’t rent anywhere where Lincoln properties is the management group, they raise your rates but don’t upgrade anything inside apt only outside.

Staff tried to prorate it from &quot;market value&quot;, which, for half the month, was less than $100 cheaper than our full monthly amount. Had to talk to 3 different staff members 4 different times to get it lowered. 2. Half the outlets in our house were broken. The AC was broken for a couple nights (in the summer), and it was leaking all the time. The shower handle broke, and the sink clogged, and maintenance never fixed it. They&apos;d call the least responsive tenant we had living with us and say they couldn&apos;t get in, even when we left notes on the door telling maintenance to come in.

Apparently she was just intending never to let it get fixed. She argues with everyone and just makes up excuses why she can&apos;t do her job.

From start to end you will be faced with nothing but problems and noone who cares about your problems. I have read all negative reviews and they are all CORRECT & FACTUAL.
The nicer reviews are staff workers who dont seem to have a life.

-They hire a new maintenance worker every month&#44; so you never know who they are and if they really work here. They all seem to be illegal aliens even office staff (ugh)they dont have uniforms so they look like bums. 

-People come into your apartment without permission!!
-This place has a lot of crime&#44; I remember just several months ago a man stole a car and ran in into the front gate almost killing the security guy. I know people who currently live here who have also had break In and their vehicle stolen.
-The pictures of trash bins&#44; well they look like that weekly

The pool is never open&#44; my air conditioning went out the beginning of the month&#44; took two weeks to fix.  Now I&#39;m boiling water to bathe due to a water heater that needs to be replaced.  They replaced the ceiling fan and it still doesn&#39;t work.  Toilet runs continously.  Numberous un-watched children screaming/playing in parking lots until all hours of the night.  Can&#39;t take a walk without smelling dope.  Wake up in the middle of the night to gunshots.  Panhandlers begging for money when you go to your car.  People digging through the trash bins.  Neighbor stands in front of window naked&#44; complex says he can do whatever he wants in the privacy of his own home.  Shopping carts everywhere on grounds.,real_apartment_review

This became obvious when my apartment was burglarized by someone who simply rammed or kicked their way in.  The deadbolt easily split and tore the old wood of the door frame.  The police didn&#39;t respond until six hours after I originally reported it.  I suspect they were busy with other problems&#44; as the area is one of the worst in town.  They finally arrived to take my report and leave&#44; but of course I never got any of my belongings back&#44; as only about 5&#37; of property crimes in the area are ever solved.  Management replaced the door and frame&#44; but it didn&#39;t seem much safer afterwards.<br><br>Loud music was an occasional issue&#44; but the worst noise came from the big C-130s from D-M AFB&#44; which flew over regularly and had the added feature of triggering many car alarms.<br><br>The apartments are spacious and relatively inexpensive&#44; but this also attracts a bad element.  I was never sure who my neighbor really was&#44; because I saw at least seven different people coming and going regularly&#44; and even some others occasionally.  Of course it&#39;s normal to have visitors&#44; but I suspect that several families were living there at the same time.  Parking was a problem because all these people took the few remaining guest parking spots.  When they argued (which was often)&#44; I could hear all of it.  They sometimes sat out front in an old pickup truck with the engine running&#44; and the exhaust smoke wafted through my entire apartment&#44; even with the windows and door tightly sealed.  The police and sheriffs were frequently in the complex for various problems.  Around midnight one night&#44; there was a drive-by shooting in the next building down.  After that&#44; I got out and stayed out.,real_apartment_review

You can contact me and I will give you dates and details. This apartment complex is close enough to 29th that it still has the scum type residents and employees of any apartment complex in ghetto town 29th. The apartments are trashy&#44; dirty&#44; have graffiti all over the walls. The maintenance requests do not get done and the management is worse than the rest. It may be affordable but so are the apartments on Golf Links&#44; Harrison&#44; Broadway&#44; Speedway etc. Columbus Village does the same credit check as any of the nicer complexes and you can live knowing your property is safe. Please email me for detailed information. Also&#44; one of the staff made the comment that they were embarrassed by the sign because it states it is luxury living and they are aware that it is far from being luxury at all.,real_apartment_review
